BBQ",,Hit And Miss,"Strange as this may sound but this was the first time I have tried Mookata (be it in Thailand or Singapore). You may wonder though why it has taken me so long to try something that combines two of my favourite things --- Korean bbq and Chinese steamboat.
The premise of mookata is very simple. The unique shape of the hot plate allows sliced meat to be grilled on the ""dome"" in the middle and vegetables and other ingredients to be cooked in the surrounding ""trough"" which is filled with soup. The juices of the bbq meat are allowed to flow into the trough to enhance the flavours of the soup.
To be honest, I find mookata a little expensive since a platter for 4 costs $30 to $40 before add-ons. The quality is also hit and miss. But it saves you the time and effort from prep work, cleaning up (eg scrubbing the grill) and having a living room reeking of oil for the next few days. Once in a while, okay lah!",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/3086f0f020024fbfacca1907846_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Halal",,Loved the Kothu Prata here!,"Not sure if people know what Kothu Prata is, but it's really worth a try!
Instead of order your usual Plain or Egg Prata, you can try order Kothu Prata, which is basically prata but shredded, then stir-fried with some form of protein, onions and spices.
The rendition here cost $6 and came in a big portion. Not too spicy, you can taste alot of the aromatics and the texture of the prata is of the softer kind. This resembles very closely to fried kway teow! The protein they added to the dish is their fried chicken, which intensified the savoury flavours.
Really loved this dish and I will order it again!",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/1685318581_review_image1969458_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

However, we liked that they were served really warm with a crisp exterior and a rather fluffy interior. 😋 Be sure to pair the fried mantou with the condensed milk because while the plain mantou tastes decent, adding the condensed milk gives it an additional layer of sweetness and makes it a great appetiser! Given the size, paying $5.50++ per mantou is pretty good value.

Being a newbie to this type of grilled fish cooking, it made me really excited and wanted to dig in immediately
With just 2 levels of spiciness indicated on the menu for our selected dish, my expectations were low, and boy was I wrong lol - I wasn’t prepared to have my mouth numb (my spice/numbness tolerance is not that high lol). The dish came in on a big hot pot with butterflied fish and green peppers & peppercorns on top. I tasted the broth by itself immediately (just shows how much I was enticed by it) hence the numbness lol - but it was good. Not too salty, nor too spicy. It could be a bit rich as it boils (we had to remove some peppers)
Enjoyed the fish a lot - quite plump, tender and smooth, very easy to debone. Fish with the broth + rice is 👌🏻 We have ordered the Golden Combination ($13.90++) as well consisting of Golden Mushroom, Potato, Lotus Root, Crab Stick/Luncheon Meat, plus a whole lot of other add-ons (at $3.90++ each) as our sides - helped to absorb the richness of the broth and fill us up
Keen to have this dish again 💕

We shared the rice cakes amongst three of us and the serving was just right. You may not want to order this if you are a small eater because the rice cake layer can get pretty filling.

We ordered the signature grilled limbo fish with green pepper, as the gravy was only slightly spicy and we loved the rather strong dose of numbness that came with the peppercorn! We doused our rice with the gravy and it was really nice to eat with the fish, which was cooked really well with a crispy exterior, and no fishy taste/smell. 😋
For the ingredients, we added beancurd tofu, enoki mushrooms and potatoes! Do be sure to eat the potatoes first because they tend to ""dissolve"" into the gravy if you leave them in the broth for too long, hence wasting them!
While the price of the fish is pretty steep at $45++, it is more than enough to be shared amongst 3 pax and the price per pax thus becomes very reasonable.",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/2f33ba123d36470c20f41934576_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Delivery",探鱼,Grilled Fish,"We ordered their signature fish with green peppers. Not a fan of spicy food, I shifted the green peppers to one side towards my husband. So my side was very managable in terms of spiciness.
The fish was huge and very meaty. But the gravy/sauce was really salty and it took quite a bit of veg, noodles and bean curd skin to balance out the saltiness. Only towards the end of our dining did I feel that my hair won't drop anymore :)
The waiters were kind and attentive. Nice ambience. Would definitely recommend this place to fish lovers who don't mind dropping their hair to taste good solid fish.",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/3370ed2d7d5316cd4f881925712_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

When it comes to their grilled fish, I always recommend going for the Limbo Fish with Fresh Green Pepper. The Limbo Fish is fresh and very tender, while the fresh green pepper adds that spicy oomph and numbing kick to the broth. It’s really appetising, and you might want to get extra bowls of rice to eat with the broth!
For sides, you could do well to get the Double Taste Rice Cake (crispy and QQ), Chongqing Cold Noodle w/ Shredded Chicken (very mouthwatering!), Grilled Oyster w/ Minced Garlic (quite savoury!) and the Fried Mantou (goes so well with the condensed milk!).
To cut through the rich food, get their refreshing Jumbo Lemon & Lime Drink. End the meal off with something to reminisce your childhood with: Malt Candy!
The new outlet is bright, spacious, and done up in vivid orange hues to match their logo. We also liked that the food standard here is as consistent as their other outlets.

Maggi goreng was super flavourful in its own right, and I found the maggie better than the Mee rendition because it managed to encapsulate most of the flavour. It contained dices of potatoes, onions, and vegetables inside, but other than that, nothing much. Was hoping a fried egg would come with it but I think you’ll have to add it on separately! Nonetheless, with the portion and taste, I thought it was decent.

We didn’t get the crisp prata we’d like and are used to but these were decent Indian “pancakes”. While I found the sambal tasty with a sweet end-note; it didn’t induce a “wipe the sambal saucer clean” reaction. Instead I found myself only veering toward the fish curry that had a tangy assam dimension; the mutton curry beside was flat and largely untouched.",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/3768ef0f42c962e20681631093_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

31st October last year, I did a post on @indulge.3foodies with the caption ""中西合壁"" and this time round, they recently opened up their Express concept store in the East! Yayy 🎉
.
Indulge Express Bowl comes with choice of short grain rice, Japanese soba or garden salad that includes 1x onsen egg, with price ranging from $6.50 to $16.50.
.
Be sure to try out their new dish that's only exclusively available at Tampines Outlet: Australian Marbled Beef, priced at the uttermost range for the Express Bowl, the quality of meat used and overall taste indeed makes it worthwhile giving this bowl a try. My favourite of all is their Fried Chicken Cutlet drizzled with nacho cheese that's well coated and crispy on the outlet, tender on the inside. 😋
.
Do check out their other menu items as well such as pastas, mains and burgers that will definitely satisfy your cravings.

Pasta",木萌,Cheesy Spicy Grilled Fish,"Moments'木萌 isn’t a name that is particularly new to F&B scene at this current juncture — already operating an outlet at Blk 326 Serangoon Avenue 3, their very first space is located right beside the now-defunct Cottontail Creamery, which has since been re-branded as Gusta Sourdough Pizza Co. in recent times. Opening a fairly new outlet in Tampines, the new outpost of Moments'木萌 is located at Blk 481 Tampines Street 44, which is a stone’s throw away from a bus stop with bus services operating out of Tampines Bus Interchange. Decked with a similar colour scheme as per their first outlet in Serangoon, the Tampines outlet features turquoise and white colour scheme — the furnishings at this outlet carries a slightly modern touch with gold accents around the counters and neon lightings on the wall. Being a brand by the same folks behind JWS Grille Factory; a familiar name to some best known for serving up Western fare in various coffeeshops located in the heartlands, the menu at Moments'木萌 mainly comprises of western fares though also features other local favourites such as zichar dishes (think Seafood Mui Fan, Yang Zhou Fried Rice, Sin Chew Bee Hoon with Tiger Prawn etc.), as well as Ban Mian, Mini Pot with Rice, and Toast & Bread items. The list of beverages available at Moments'木萌 is also pretty extensive — think local beverages such as that of Kopi and Teh to simple concoctions like Honey Yuzu; all the way to Yakult-based beverages, sparking fruit juice, milkshakes and soda.
Admittedly, it was the Iced Kopi that brought us here to Moments'木萌 — the presentation is akin to the overflowing Iced Ipoh White Coffee which has slowly made its way into the dining scene in Singapore; similar to the ones served at Nan Yang Dao at Blk 261 Serangoon Central, and that of the Ipoh White Coffee stall at some Malaysia Boleh! and Boleh Boleh! food courts. That being said, we found ourselves going for the Cheesy Spicy Grilled Fish for our food option since we had made our visit to Moments'木萌 for lunch on a weekend afternoon. Being an item off the “Fish” section of the menu, the Cheesy Spicy Grilled Fish features grilled fish “topped with chef’s spicy sauce and melted cheese”, and comes with two sides of the patron’s choice — we went for the Mac & Cheese and the Truffle Spinach & Mushroom for our order. Going for the sides first, both the Mac & Cheese and the Truffle Spinach & Mushroom were decent, though could definitely do some refinement — the former had a nacho cheese sauce that was reasonably dense, though the cheesy notes felt a tad muted and seem to fall flat somewhere in between. While the spinach in the Truffle Spinach & Mushroom was done pretty soft and easy to chew, we felt that the lack of a dressing or sauce made the spinach seem a little dry; the truffle aroma also was pretty non-existent, though we liked how the mushrooms provided a good bounciness and earthiness nonetheless. The fish came with a crisp exterior, while the flesh was reasonably moist; we liked how the chef’s spicy sauce was almost akin to a spicy salsa spread across the fish for a tingling hint of spice that provides a good level of heat that would go well with those who can tolerate moderate levels of spiciness — cuts through the blanket of melted cheese that is a crowd-pleaser on its own being all gooey and stretchy.
Having tried only two items off the menu at Moments'木萌, we felt that Moments'木萌 is a spot for hearty fare in the neighbourhood that would work for people of all ages — a suitable spot for family dinners or gatherings alike, considering the vast number of items available on the menu. The Cheesy Spicy Grilled Fish is an item that came with a quality expected within new-style western stalls often found in coffeeshops and food courts; not surprising considering how Moments'木萌 are run by the same folks behind JWS Grille Factory, which is a known name within that sphere. That being said, Moments'木萌 is a great extension of JWS Grille Factory; one that is a stand-alone restaurant of its own that provides patrons an air-conditioned environment to dine at in comfort. Prices of the food at Moments'木萌 may be at a slight premium over coffeeshop or food court counterparts — most items are priced below $20; the only exceptions being the double / triple patty burgers, combo platters and some of the beef & ribs items. We would certainly be back for their Iced Kopi — they do brew a pretty good one that is also frothy and rich; we are looking forward to be back some day to give their Toast & Bread items a try though!",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/1666787622_review_image1953865_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Most of the side dishes here, except for fried chicken, were really lacklustre with respect to taste. The flavours were feeble, blatantly shy of being memorable. And wow that bergedel was all kinds of wrong as it was painfully bland and diabolically dry…it's the antipode of a good one, so that was unfortunate. 🙁 (4.2/10)",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/59725ce69b653fa7f421547894_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Ordered the Salted Caramel and Arabica Coffee flavours thinking they would pair well but was met with so-so ice cream.
The flavours were one-dimensional and lacked depth. The first few bites were refreshing but it quickly got cloying and it became a chore to finish. The ice cream texture was rather light and cut through very easily; it was not my preferred texture.
I found it to be a bit on the pricier side as well, costing $14.90 in total. We had to queue for quite awhile to get in but if I could go back in time, I don't think I would have queued for it.",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/2f3e1a475010fd53037a1922529_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

From açai bowls to waffles loaded with scoops of ice-cream, Around is surely a place you can’t miss. While you’re here, give their highly-rated pistachio ice cream a try! As Burppler Foodie W puts it, “The waffle was served warm and was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and went well with nutella. Ice cream was also good, especially the pistachio as it was nutty, rich and smooth.”
Come on over and whisk yourself away from metropolitan Singapore for a while, all with a good bowl of dessert!

Waffles",,Hands down to another fantastic waffle place.🥳,"Waffle with 2 scoop($14.90++)😋
Around cafe served up really damn thick and on point waffle that doesn't compromise the taste of it. These waffle can literally make up a meal. Got so full after downing that waffle.
Crispy crusty outer with soft fragrant fluffly inner and ends with a light sweet pleasant note after every bite.
Waffle were decorated with spam of Nutella, mini marshmallow and sugar icing. Or you can also opt for maple syrup and biscoff crumble topping.
I wouldn't say the scoop served were big but it was just nice to go with that size of waffle.
Their ice cream were pretty chilled, creamy, intense, dense and heavy in flavour.😋
Matcha - Bittersweet. Great choice.
Strawberry Cheesecake - Cheesy. Overpower the strawberry bits in it.
Speculoos - Rough. Sweet. Biscuity.
Peanut Butter & Blueberries - Smooth. Peanut butter taste strong. Can't really taste much of the blueberries in it.
.
Original crepe cake($7.90)☹️
Stacks of very thin pancake filled with thick layer of cream in between. Looks good but taste otherwise. Too jelat, too creamy, too plain and have a stale taste.
.
Floral Hibiscus mocktail($6.90)🤨
Don't get conned by this pretty looking drink. Somehow it tasted like toothpaste though I like the fizziness of the drink which make it somewhat refreshing but still a nope for me. Can't taste the floral note in it.

Ichiban Bento (Tampines 1),1 REVIEW,1 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$10/pax,Japanese,,Chicken Cutlet Bento Love the presentation as it came with a lid kinda like a box which u can open..,"but other than that, nothin much to remember as the chicken seems to be pre-fry, left in the open for a while and then refry upon serving..seasoning taste very 'food court' style. The other sides are all mediocre.. even the egg is only half a piece.. the next time I will probably save the $8.50 and go for 'cai fan' in which you won't set any unnecessary expectations😐

Bubble Tea",,Green Milk Tea with Pearls,"I love the combination of green tea and milk tea. And personally, I prefer iTea's milk tea than Koi's and Liho's (no offence guys!)
iTea's brewed black tea which has been mixed with milk and sugar (you can choose your sugar level, I usually opt for 50%) taste has been consistent all these while. Neither too bitter nor too bland. The green tea flavour here isn't too overpowering, I believed its infused with jasmine and green tea leaves which is just spot on. If more ice cubes were added, it could have had spoiled the bubble tea honestly. The tapioca pearls were chewy too even after refrigerating it for more than two hours. Worth the money? Definitely.
Large Green Milk Tea $2.00 + pearls $0.60
Total: $2.60
ps: I'd probably have to pay double the amount if I were to buy from Koi or Liho............. hmm",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/61d5c6f1cf7e8e227ce1566107_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Delivery",,"The renowned White Restaurant has recently premiered the brand’s first-ever express concept – White Express on 30 July, located at the basement of Tampines Mall.","This concept from @whitebeehoonrestaurant caters to people with busy lifestyles but yet wants a great comforting meal, and that is where White Express comes into the picture with value-for-money and quality options from the original restaurant and new dishes in the menu. Besides the ala carte options, there are also bundle sets that come with a main and choice of drink, all under a wallet-friendly price of $11.
For the main, you can choose from their iconic Original White Bee Hoon to Mala White Bee Hoon, Prawn & Chinese Sausage Fried Rice and the newly launched Silver Fish & Chicken Fried Rice. The Original White Bee Hoon needs no further introduction as it is the signature dish that propelled them to fame and it comes with seafood ingredients such as squid and prawns cooked in their rich broth with white bee hoon. You can also top up $2.40 to $4.80 to add on sides such as Homemade Soy Tofu with Minced Pork, Stir-fried Broccoli with Garlic or the Signature Meat & Seafood Roll, the latter also now comes in a frozen packet ($10) that you can prepare and enjoy at your convenience.

When it was good, it was amazing — melt in your mouth fluffy clouds kind of amazing, but when it wasn’t it felt like I was biting on a sponge 🧽. Needless to say, this was pretty inconsistent. The cream that coated the top had the slightest vanilla flavouring: good that it didn’t overshadow the soufflé. 😛

Available to order in a single pancake or in a stack of three, the soufflé pancake here is all light, soft and wobbly — pretty airy whilst the cream adds on to the pancake with its subtle hint of sweetness. The matcha here isn't really detectable, save for the sprinkling of matcha powder over the top which seems to be there more for the visual appeal than for the taste factor.

Kapitans by Kopitiam (Tampines 1),37 REVIEWS,15 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$5/pax,Kopitiam,,"You definitely wouldn't expect damn good fried hokkien mee, let alone one that has won awards, inside a food court.","However, I was truly blown away by how good this plate is for its price point at $5.30 (there's a larger plate at $6.30). If you like your fried hokkien noodles less wet, with almost no zhup kind but still slippery smooth, then this is what you have been missing out on. Looking at how the guy behind the wok handles the noodles, the constant flipping and stirring of the thick bee hoon and yellow noodles result in a slight charred flavour while he pours a stock onto the noodles and adds in the usual suspects of sotong and prawns before serving. By the side, you can add in the sambal, which I highly recommend you stir that into your noodles, and a spoonful of crispy pork lard for that added comfort.

Loved the well marinated sauce going with the chicken, without them the chicken wouldn't even be that good. Chicken were pretty inconsistent, some were really crispy on the exterior but some were not. Just tender meat inside, but with the sauce, it kinda saved the day.

I liked the flavours in this bowl and enjoyed everything with their extra hot sauce to amp up the spice! We also had Boneless Chicken Thighs with sides and they were very tender with how their chicken is freshly grilled-to-order. We washed everything down with rooibos peach tea and it was especially great for caffeine sensitive people like me 🤗 with everything at nett pricing and no service charge, prices are affordable and the food is value for money too!

Really liked them, the meatballs were tender and not firm like Chinese meatballs and they have a really nice meaty flavour too. Plus the sauces were really interesting, especially the berry jam, which surprisingly worked really well with the savoury meatballs.",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/1675940312_review_image1961449_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

I was given huge chunks of pork ribs that were drenched in their black pepper sauce and as messy as it looked, it was really scrumptious. The meat itself were really tender, like you don't even need a knife to cut through the meat. All you need is a spoon really! The meat was also very succulent and well seasoned. The sauce itself is incredibly rich, with a strong pepper flavour and it was slightly tangy. Indeed a steal for such a delicacy!

Their cage-free chicken wings are larger than most, and their marinade-batter-double-fry technique has resulted in an addictively delicious rendition, with many attempting to emulate and recreate the taste.
.
The skin is crispy and crunchy, while the juicy tender chicken meat comes easily off the bone. Best eaten piping hot, for maximum enjoyment of its meaty savoury salty spice sweet flavour.

Not only is IKEA a popular spot for furniture, their restaurant is crazy popular as well!! We never fail to get their meat balls and chicken wings, dishes we've loved since young👭. We especially love their chicken wings🍗, crispy and juicy, simply can't stop at just one! Also, the idea of meat balls, gravy and lingonberry jam may sound weird, but this sweet and savoury combination works well together, love it😍! Got their cheese tart🧀 to try for the first time and it pretty cheesy and flowy, not bad at all.
For us, IKEA is not just a place about the furniture or food, but a place with great memories. Eating at the restaurant, followed by a walk through the furniture store, and ending off with a hotdog bun🌭 or ice cream🍦 at the takeaway kiosk is like a routine for us everytime we're there.

Finally got to try their salted egg chicken and it was legit👌
Honestly salted egg can go quite terribly wrong sometimes and I was not so sure about this. But it turned out pretty nice!!!!
That buttery golden sauce had just the right amount of sweetness and saltiness, drizzled over that crispy and juicy chicken cutlet.❣️
However, my friend said it can get abit greasy for her so I do recommend sharing!!
Sadly it is unavailable until the end of this November..
▶️Swedish meatballs-
Not ordering this is like coming singapore and not trying chilli/black pepper crab
▶️Marinated salmon-
There’s just something about their sauce and their salmon that attracts me🤤
▶️Salmon fillet with broccoli-
I love the sauce because I love sour stuff but the salmon had a very strong fishy taste but overall it was pretty cool.
▶️Cheese tart($2.60)-

Late adopter to trends in general and I have never had this cos it’s just not in me to have this over meatballs at IKEA you know? So after confirming a distinct drop in the flavours and satisfaction of the meatballs this past 2 years (I found this true sort of across a number of countries consistently), meatballs no longer stood no.1 and I finally gave this a shot!
Loving the creamy fluffy buttery potato cake speckled with broccoli. YUM YUM 😊👌🏻 salmon was aaalright too!

With a mixture of beef and pork, the meatballs paired impeccably with the brown sauce and lingonberry jam.

Pasta",*Halal-certified,[HALAL] Multiple Award Winning Heartland Café!👍,"Finally here at @crazekitchensg to try their (once upon a time) SGD10 NETT pasta with giant chicken chop or double fish fillets!😄
👉Aglio Olio - SGD11
your choice of meat, garlic, parsley, red kraut, linguine & fresh chilli
Served with 2 huge crispy fish fillet, I must say their Aglio Olio was well-executed and not a run-of-the-mill dish. Really fragrant but quite spicy too!😌
Special mention goes to their brown sauce, which surprisingly stood out for me.

Salmon Carbonara, $15. Relatively new cosy halal restaurant open in the neighbourhood. There’s a wide range of meat selection for their different pasta and we had Salmon Carbonara. The salmon is huge and thick with crispy grilled skin with chunky juicy meats. Carbonara Pasta is very fragrant and not too creamy and jelak. It also comes with a mushroom sauce to dip the salmon. It’s very worthy and the price is reasonable and portion is decent. Another great news, no GST & service charge! .

Coincidentally, we all ordered all their fish items and i tried their Two On The Hook which came slightly charred burger base with double fried halibut fish topped with harissa chilli, torched cheese, greens, tomatoes, cucumber, salad & curly fries. And I must say their burger is definitely bigger than the usual ones. 😂

Also, their friendly staff did came to over to our table and asked if everything was alright on a few occasions! Recommend to visit if you are around the area. 👍🏻

My family and myself included, adores the food there especially the Fujian Lor Mee and PUTIEN Sweet & Sour Pork with Lychees, among the wide variety of menu items that they have. The quality of food that you are getting with the price point is value-for-money and satisfying at the same time. Once the circuit breaker has been lifted and we can slowly go back to our normal lives, we can then make visits to PUTIEN once again. Till then, it shall be takeaways from the outlets, and they are having set meals in addition to their existing ala carte items, which the latter is having a 20% off all takeaways.

This set also comes with 2 bottles of pearl barley with winter melon beverage. Fortunately, they are also still retailing their Spice Mum Chili Sauce ($7.40), which is an absolute essential condiment to your every meal. I will usually spam the chili sauce into my lor mee and hence, I will most likely need more than the given serving.

I love these mooncakes for both their crumbly flaky pastry and the fillings. It’s low in sugar, and any sweetness I had tasted appears to come mostly from the premium ingredients – Thai premium taro (the same one used for the signature fried taro dish at PUTIEN), and Japan’s first grade purple sweet potato. These were peeled, sliced, steamed, mashed, then stir-fried with oil into a smooth texture. Indeed, Madam Leng is commited to offering “fresh ingredients, original taste” for these mooncakes based on her home recipe.

Good For Groups",,Putien remains one of our favourites for tasty Chinese food.,"Whether their meat, vegetables or noodles, they always served up good tasting dishes.
Loved this Putien Loh Mee for its slightly starchy and flavourful gravy, although their dry Hin Hwa fried beehoon tasted just as good. Our list of their tasty dishes could go on and go. Their braised intestines, fried mackerel, trio-egg spinach, Hin Hwa oyster omelette, herbal prawn, etc. Most importantly, never forget to eat them with their awesome Putien chilli. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #burpproved #putien #lohmee",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/4f71bcc46b8df3196ea1458397_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Bamboo Steamed herbal prawn ($5.90++) for 1 serving which came with 2 prawns. The broth is light and slightly sweet, but the prawns could be fresher.
Deep-fried squirrel fish ($38++): my fave fish dish because it's totally boneless! Tastes somewhat like sweet-n-sour fish actually haha.

Zi Char",麻辣味 · 集,"Food Is Great Here, Especially Their Chicken Stew In Pig's Stomach!","[Invited Tasting] Been going for this stall for their affordably priced mala tang and mian xian, and I am glad to be able to try more dishes here!
One of my favourites got to be their Chicken Stew in Pig's Stomach ($13.80). It boasts a soup that reminds me alot of a thick chicken broth with herbal ingredients. The chicken itself is very flavourful and really tender. Even the chicken breast is absolutely delicious! The pig stomach is fresh as well.
The Grilled Fishes ($24.80 each) are fresh and the spicy numbing one lives up to its name, and I do prefer the pickled cabbage flavour, due to its slight tanginess.
Their mala tang is not too bad, but their Mian Xian is even better. You can choose a variety of ingredients and the noodles are the best! The noodles are really chewy and very slurp worthy!
As for the cold dishes, the Sliced Pork Belly with Spicy Garlic Sauce ($6.80) is really addictive, as the umami from the garlic really complements the chilli oil. The Mala Toss Mixed Mushroom ($3.80) is a tad too oily, but nonetheless still satisfying.
Will be back definitely. Thanks for the invite @burpple 😋",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/5e97b6941b3e1255fec1935283_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Western","An authentic charcoal grill concept, El Carbón® aims to deliver the best HALAL Western food stall experience by sourcing exclusively from the best suppliers islandwide.","So smoky, really delicious!","Ordered El Carbon for dinner takeaway, and was so pleasantly surprised by the quality of their mains!
One worthy mention got to be their Grilled Lamb Chop with Chicken Sausage ($19.80 with soup, 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond). The lamb chops may appear dry, but they were really tender and very well seasoned without much gamey flavour. They have managed to infuse so much smoky char flavour in the meat and that itself was really wonderful! The black pepper sauce has the right amount of savouriness and pepper flavours and complemented well with the lamb chops.
The chicken sausage also has a significant char flavour which makes it addictive as well!
The aglio olio was al dente and very garlicky. It may be abit too salty, but still enjoyable nonetheless.
Quality hawker western food indeed!",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/1680800879_review_image1965583_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Portion is pretty huge, it's slightly crispier at the edges and they were generous with their masala potatoes fillings too. Neither too spicy nor too starchy. And I love their chutneys especially the cream-white coconut one! I even shamelessly asked for a refill cos it was too good. You can taste the freshness of the coconut pulp ground and the tamarind in every mouthful.

Jiak Song is probably familiar to most ban mian lovers, with its many outlets opened all around Singapore. I had the Mee Hoon Kueh with minced pork, pork slices and pork ball ($5) and although the pork ingredients were well seasoned and very tender, the handmade noodles and sauce are the highlights. The noodles were very chewy and had a wonderful bite! The sauce itself somehow has that slight wok hei taste and gives a wonderful smoky umami to the noodles. My only gripe is that it's really a small portion, probably will add a dollar to add more noodles next time!",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/5e97b692a964815b5361932295_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

🍗 🐟The Chicken Thigh is tender and the Dory fish fillet are cooked to crisp at the sides. Both proteins are doused with the Indonesian BBQ sauce, in my opinion it's just Kecap Manis(Indonesian sweet sauce), which is nice for the first few bites but I feel it gets too sweet towards the end.
🍛 You have a option to add curry to your rice and I think you should! It balance out the sweetness of the BBQ sauce abit and also adds flavour to the rice.
🌶️🍳🥗 The chilli, and runny egg yolk together with the curry, forms the golden triangle of condiments. Mixed them all up together and you have flavour explosion every mouthful. Haha. Ok I exaggerated but they do go well together. The cabbage plays the role of clearing your palate in-between the heavy sauces.
Overall, it's a satisfying meal but will only eat it maybe once or twice a year as the sauces and seasoning are really heavy. I believe the meal already provided the sugar and sodium consumption for the month 😂",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/33f3b3f403a1448972101927464_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

It was far from the normal sausage that is being served on breakfast. Chinese sausage has distinct smell, texture and taste. As a child, anything unusual is doubtful. As I grow older, being adventurous towards the unusual is a self-fulfilment. 😊 It's just amazing how time can change us, whether that 'change' is good to others or not. Reality is, we cannot just be the same all the time. ⌚️

Cheap & Good",,Pork Ban Mian (Dry),"My all-time favourite Ban Mian at my area ☺️ No wonder every single time I had their ban mian, there will always be customers queuing for the food.
I always ordered their dry pork ban mian (with extra noodles and pork slices - yknow I am a growing boy and I workout too so I need to have more). The noodles is so al dente as they used the noodles machine. It comes with black soysauce and it goes so well when you combine everything together 😍 (must add their chilli for the kick)
A flaw will be that the waiting time can be long if you do not have the patience for it as it can be as close to half an hour or more during peak hour. The vegetables could have been more but you can always add-on like $0.50 for that and other ingredients as well (such as minced chicken, pork, egg, noodles, vegetables).
Tip: Order through Fairprice app where you can advance order and also get 10% discount. However, the timing of the food stated in the app is not accurate at all so do not count on that. I suggest u place order like half an hour in advance as they will take awhile to prepare your order. Also, show your order number to the workers when you reached the stall so they know).
It has always been my go-to hearty noodles to have during weekend whenever I have craving for it.

A rich thick consistency took hold of this sweet-salty sauce. It evoked the tangy, pungent taste of mustard. Paired with the crispy and crunchy US fries, it is a sinful yet ironically, environmentally-friendly combination. Taking into account that IKEA used plant-based 🌱 meat, I think IKEA did a pretty good job. 👏",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/33bf70606a54d86f9f541913280_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Fast Food",,Salmon Fillet with Broccoli 🐟🥦(S$9.90).,"The salmon melts under the knife. Soft, smooth and tender! As I tried it for the first time, the salmon was unexpectedly firm and chewy. The gorgeous light-pink meat revealed its subtle glamour. The sauce was an excellent accompaniment. It carried honey-like 🍯 properties. Infused with the zest of lemon 🍋, the sauce is a light and refreshing complement to the rich delectable salmon. I thought the side characters would pale in comparison but I was dead wrong. The broccoli 🥦 was fresh and crunchy. It hightlights the richness of the salmon and tones down the zesty lemon 🍋 sauce. Then, we have the second main lead (like 2 guys 🧍🧍‍♂️competing for 1 girl🧍‍♀️), the potato cake is fighting for the spotlight. It is a mixture of broccoli bits 🥦, mashed potato and crunchy potato chunks within. The potato cake alternated between the 2 dimensions: soft and crunchy. Pan-frying gave it a slightly charred taste that was irresistible. It is a close fight but as always, the main lead (salmon) never loses. 🤷‍♂️",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/33bf70606a54652d6ce61913279_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

I enjoyed the ASMR crunch with every bite, less so about the bread crumbs all over my lap LOL (but it's not a biggie). 🥖The pickled carrots and radishes added a contrasting tang against the meatier elements of the sandwich while providing a pleasant crunchiness.

Admittedly, with my big appetite, this alone wasn't sufficient to fill me up. But dang, I'm glad I made the trip here because it was delicious. Should've bought 2x Banh Mis - maybe a pork one too.

Sandwiches",,"I love my sandwiches, and especially the Vietnamese Bánh mì.","Biting into the crispy baguette followed by the layers of pork pâté, pork slices, fresh greens like cucumber and coriander, and the tangy dồ chua of pickled radish and carrots is just a joy every single time. It’s hard to replicate the feeling of eating a bánh mì along the streets of Vietnam and not many in Singapore is able to create that flavour, excitement and joy that I have experienced previously. Fortunately, I have found one such place along Geylang Road named Banh Mi Thit, and that is one of my go-to places for a good solid Vietnamese sandwich. I was elated to find out that they have actually opened another outlet in Tampines recently, which makes it even easier for me to get my bánh mì fix in the future. This time round, I have gone for their Pork Bánh Mì ($5.50) and I highly recommend you add a fried egg for a dollar to complete the whole experience.

Bread & Pastries",,Honey Seasalt Crossiant,"Walked past basement 1 of Tampines 1 to get my groceries where I happened to see this pop-up crossiant shop that seems to be popular as I read it one time at Eatbook news I think.
Since there wasn’t any queue, I gave it a try as I love me some good crossiant. There were only a couple of flavours that were available around 5pm on a weekend. If I remember correctly, honey seasalt and strawberry flavours were the best selling as they were 1-2 pieces left.
Honestly, kinda disappointing as the honey glaze overpower entirely and quite sweet... The seasalt taste was not prominent at all too. However, it was flaky on the outside and soft on the inside. One bite and all the flakes dropped.
I’m not sure if I will get the savoury options as the price was expensive.. it was $4.86 for this. It cost $4 above for all of the flavours if I am not wrong. But, do give it a try if you are a crossiant/carbs lover.
Overall, it is a decent crossiant but I probably stick to my plain crossiant from somewhere that is affordable.

The egg noodles are cooked too long, making it rather soggy and the sauce mixture that is tossed with it is lacking the oomph or umami factor. The only probable saving grace is the roasted pork which has a nice crunch on the skin. Otherwise, the char siew is nothing mind-blowing with many better options out there and the onsen egg is probably there for the trend.

definitely a must try for truffle and mushroom pizza! those who love truffle will love it (this truffle pizza is the best one i have eaten and i always order this when i visit harry's). the steak was damn good too ordered medium rare and it was very tender. fish n chips was good too as it was very crispy but i feel had a stronger fishy taste than other fish n chips i had eaten. the only dish not worth the money was the carbonara. taste of the cream sauce is weird and as a carbonara lover myself, i give that carbonara 5/10 (considering its ingredients).
do take note that the steak and fish n chips are not included in burpple deal.",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/30a75a772cafbc91e2ca1890886_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Moroccan Chicken
What was good:
Definitely the chicken. Cooked perfectly. Something I would order again.
Review:
Chicken was cooked to perfection. I'm not sure how Moroccan food is supposed to taste like, but I can say that the taste of the herbs did not overwhelm the meat. Sauce was okay, complimented the meat and herbs.
Came with pilaf which was prepared with raisins. Not as fragrant. Just focus on the chicken.
Texture (5/5):
Perfect. Not dry, cooked right in.
Price (2/5):
About $24. But what would you expect dining at a bar right.
Value for Money (4/5):
Not bad, for the food quality and atmosphere I got. Not something I would come for everyday.
Verdict (4/5):
I will not come here everyday for this, but if I do come back again, I may order this again (If I do not feel adventurous).",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/445ef04deedd775ccee1301839_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Otah Toasties was something new to me - crispy bread with Otah that was so freakin' spicy! Their Signature Wings was tastes/marinated like Har Cheong. Sausages tastes like Sausages. Fish Cracklings are fries Fish Skin, yums. Fries were my second favourite.
Overall, this is a platter that won't go wrong since you get a sample of snacks to go with your choice of alcohol. We had Kronenbourg 1664 Blanc ($15, full pint) and Harry's Lemonade ($10) to go with Harry's 7 🍻

Frankly speaking it is quite worth since the sidekicks & drinks that i had ordered were premium.
Have to say, the tempura will never go wrong. However, the batter was a little too thick for my liking for the cripsy chicken, popcorn chicken & fried enoki mushroom.

Bubble Tea",,Star Combo - Lu Rou Fan Set | $13.80,"For the price of $13.80, I was able to get a Star Combo Lu Rou Fan Set, which consisted of a Braised Chicken Lu Rou Fan, Salted Popcorn Chicken, and a side - which I chose original fried tofu sticks for one, and sweet potato fries for another set. The Lu Rou Fan might not be what you would expect as it doesn’t taste like those authentic braised meat rice in Taiwan with 三层肉. The braised chicken meat here is sweeter and more lean, tasting more like the meat in dumpling ba zhang/粽子. The egg was actually surprising as it was the onsen egg you’d find in ramen, and how I prefer my hard boiled eggs. Meanwhile, the salted chicken was really salty, living up to its name of 盐酥鸡... if you love salty, this really is the chicken for you. The fried tofu sticks was an interesting finger food, and the original flavour of salt and pepper complemented it well too - but it was too salty for me, so perhaps I’d choose a spicy topping next time! The sweet potato fries had an interesting taste to it, especially because it is already flavoured with their plum powder. Overall a Super worth it set as it was very filling. It came with a drink too and I ordered my Go-to - Moon River. This is one of their signature drinks, so I had to top up and additional $1. The cashier who was a young lady was really patient with me as well😂
Even more worth it with #burpplebeyond.😜 however, while I might return for their drinks and snacks or even chicken, buying this combo might be a no go for me as it really is too much😂😜

Western",,Here we are revisiting Chef Recipe at Tampines outlet.,"Personally, I feel that the western food deserves a second shoutout as well especially for their Chef Recipe Salmon ($10.50). As mentioned, Salmon is almost like eatsnapsg’s staple food and it is almost a must order item in any japanese or western food place. However, sadly not everywhere serves nice salmon. It really takes some skill to grill or panfry it, and I would still like to give a 👍 to the chef which prepared the Chef Recipe Salmon. He has put in some effort in the plating and display of the salmon and other ingredients.
In addition, the chef was really generous with the portion and has ensured the finest quality of the food served (salmon, mushroom etc). I am rather picky when it goes to Salmon and I feel that the salmon is perfectly cooked, and it definitely goes well with the sauce used. 📍Chef Recipe

Western",,Full Moon Beef Burger with Fried Sweet Potato & French Fries [$7] 🍔🍟 We went back to Food Pinnacle for lunch.,"Tried more of Chef Recipe's food menu. Craving for egg, so decided to give this a try. When I was asked what side dish I choose, I chose Fried Sweet Potatoes. Not knowing that Fries are already included in the meal. 😩 But anyway, both gave different level of sweetness and taste. Only that I was really full after I finished. The cashier should've warned me that there's already fries included. My fault, I didn't ask! 😂
The burger patty is moist and soft but the smokiness still can be tasted. I liked how the egg was cooked; not dry nor too runny. It was definitely worth my $7, such a steal! 😜😊👌🏻

This time round, I have visited Chef Recipe- Tampines, located in a coffee shop around the neighbourhood to try their Chef Recipe Salmon ($10.50).

Hawker Food",,Signature Fried Chicken With Nasi Dagang Trader Rice ($5.50 + $3 Sambal Assam Sotong),"This was once a happy discovery from Grabfood. We had been exercising a wee bit of self control on not ordering it every week because it isn’t the healthiest of choice. Now I have one more reason to not order it and get my lazy ass out because.. the price of convenience is almost double😂.
Prices start at $4 if you’re eating at the food court, and I think it’s pretty worth the satisfaction. The fried chicken thigh ($5.50) is incredibly crispy and fragrance from the spices with tumeric and a distinct lemongrass flavour, while the insides were tender and juicy! And the rice - we prefer the nasi dagang for its texture, but the steam rice is equally good because it’s so fluffy and lemak.
For sides, our go-to is the Sambal Assam Sotong ($3) which usually tastes very fresh with a good bite (this round seemed to be an off day or perhaps I was a little late for dinner, as it was slightly more rubbery but it’s the first time it happened). It isn’t too spicy (may be disappointing for those who’re looking for more heat), with the addition of pineapples for sweetness. The other would be their curry mutton ($3) which are just tender cubes of delishness, and it’s not too gamey.
The mildly sour yet refreshing achar helps to cut through the richness of the dish, and the sambal balacan really packs a punch. Ambitiously mixed it with my rice and I’ve never, purposely, added it again😂 But spicy-lovers should like this!",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/7cfe3ba8932a9b98a21785666_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Note that it's a noodle stall and not a laksa speciality stall, so the ingredients are from what they used for the other noodle dishes.
The tau pok is marinated and the sweet taste clashes with the laksa broth 👎
I'll not order their Laksa unless you are someone who likes thick and creamy laksa broth. Mind the the laksa taste is mild though.",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/33f3b3f3eefb2c0ddbda1923988_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Bubble Tea",樂一杯,Supporting Good Heartland Bubble Tea,"I'm actually quite impressed with Le Yi Bei's Taro Fresh Milk (M: $3.80 nett/ L: $4.80 nett, pictured). The taro taste is pretty robust. Pearls (+$0.50) are on the small side, but have a good chew & bounce to them.
Would buy this again! In fact, I'd like to try their actual teas - couldn't do so today as it's late in the evening & I do want to sleep tonight 😂

Bubble Tea",,Honey Green Tea | $4.20,"Here you don’t have the option of really choosing sugar levels, rather 2 options of choosing 50% or 100% honey levels. I went with the 50% honey level together with normal ice and it was just right. Decent drink, nothing surprising, only wished that the flavour of the tea could have been stronger and more apparent in this drink, especially with the staff brewing and steeping the tea right in front of you. So for $4.20, this cup of honey green tea is rather steep. Further, though decent, we waited about 20 minutes for this, which made it really not worth it.

2) Bubble Milk tea (black tea - S$4.50), it's taste like milo taste, wish the tea taste was stronger!
3) Cassia Black Tea with Mousse (S$4.70), it's taste like strong and fragrant tea tarik taste

Bubble Tea",,Oolong Latte ($3.40 For Large Size),"Date: 3/11/19
Queue was short. Had wanted to buy Liho bubble tea but since the nearest outlet is at Tampines mrt, we decided to give itea a try. Bought two oolong latte at $7.80. Couldn’t even finished half a cup though I was really thirsty. Had to throw it away. Terrible👎.
The cups were full of ice, and the drinks simply tastes like diluted sweetened milk.
I had to enquire about the free cup that comes along with 2 same drinks ordered because the staff didn’t mentioned it verbally. Their business must be very goo.
The free plastic bottle with straw was out of stock, so I settled for the (porcelain) Mug. They passed me the Mug in a mouldy box. ☹️
The tea is really not nice. I’m not sure why famous food bloggers say it is not bad.
Edit:
Ok, just go for the normal milk tea. It is much better. 100% sugar is fine. Not too sweet.",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/2f124613ec685c2906b61800181_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Kuriya Japanese Market (Tampines 1),16 REVIEWS,14 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$15/pax,Japanese,,Matcha Udon,"Another new food place uncovered at Tampines! We have visited Kuriya Market at Tampines 1 and tried the Hiyashi Char Siew Matcha Udon and Creamy Seafood Matcha Udon.
We were excited to taste the udon as it is something interesting interesting which we dont usually get to taste. The Creamy Seafood Matcha Udon was good, the bowl was filled with Japanese Matcha Green Tea noodles with prawns, mussels, Japanese fish cake, carrot & sweet corn in creamy broth. Whereas for the Hiyashi Char Siew Matcha Udon, the noodles mixed well with the pork char siew, vegetables, seaweed & bonito flakes in house special spicy sauce ($10.80). However, we preferred having the noodle without the spicy sauce as it taste a lil unique to us😂. Whereas, the matcha udon was good with a light matcha taste and the udon noodles were springly. 👍

The boss, Uncle Alex here has a naturally charismatic & funny personality! First he asked if we needed a ladder to take this shot, followed by several other jokes throughout the meal. & What made me lost it was when he said: ""I need to go, real important, need to go catch this Pokemon before he run."" 😂 He then hopped on his bicycle all the way to Pasir Ris Park nearby for a Growlithe hahahaha, a dedicated Pokemon master who've caught them all too. Good humour is a quality I always admire!
.
Uncle Alex also gave us 1-for-1 clams for the day (yay), so we chose corn broth (instead of tomyam) to go along. & After making all of them & their brother prawns go around for a full prosperity dip; I swear guys, the umami we got from then was just totally mind-blowing! Certainly one of those times I felt so glad to be alive 🤤 I'll be back!

went a little overboard and got 12 of it in 4 flavours: Nutella, Cream Cheese, Salted Caramel and Chocolate Fudge. Had the Nutella one and felt it was a little dense, not as fluffy as I would like it to be. While the Nutella fillings might not be substantial (as seen in 2nd photo), it was certainly sweet enough since there were sugar dusted all over. The team had clearly put thought into this. Anymore Nutella and it’d be a sugar bomb. Personally prefer the Cream Cheese version more as it was lighter on the palate and had the right balance of sweetness. ✨",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/3921a41431713bbdc481848223_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Delivery",,Stumbled across this Thai restaurant while burppling for thai food.,"Following the footsteps of Nakhon, the dining experience is rather similar - non-airconditioned dining establishment with outdoor seating areas, non-pretentious Thai food and of course, friendly to the wallet.
.
The Pineapple Fried Rice ($6), a staple for any Thai meal was well above average. It was sweet, and salty, with ample toppings to go with it. I found the Basil Minced Beef ($8) a tad too salty for my liking though, and I will perhaps opt for the Basil Minced Chicken in future. Of course, no Thai meal is complete without Tom Yum Soup. We opted for the Red Tom Yum Soup with Prawns ($7) and the serving size was good enough for 3. The flavours were well balanced, and it was a nice dance between the two contrasting flavours of sour and spicy. Go for the Stuffed Chicken Wings too ($6), where they don't stinge on the filling and the wings are also plump and crispy.
.
The place gets crowded pretty quickly so I do recommend an early dinner, or be prepared to queue.

Delivery",,Padpong Curry Seafood,"[Chinese: 咖喱蛋炒虾] So we were exploring Tampines and was Burppling for good food, and we saw this restaurant having good ratings. Interestingly, there's another Thai restaurant nearby, which both somehow resembles the Nakhon Kitchen concept - selling cheap Thai food in non-air-conditioned shophouses. This one is pretty localised (though there were Thai waitresses and all) with English and Chinese menus. Apart from ordering the must-haves (Pad Thai and clear Tom Yum Soup), we decided to try something special on the menu (see title of this post)! As the Chinese name suggests, the ""egg curry"" resembles the Steam Egg (see Superstar K post) fused in with tamarind (which has the pineapple rice fragrance). Though we would think the dish could be perfected with more varieties of seafood (other than just sotong/ squid and prawns) and could be less oily, we were feeling lucky to have tried this! #ThanksBurpple!",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/3f5b6abe6c44a8e8d481397532_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Delivery",,Tue's dinner affair with Pris.,"Situated among the neighborhood, this Thai restaurant is packed during dinner time. So lucky that we didn't have to wait long.
Let's see what's on our table.
Pineapple rice ($6 for small) serves as our main, love the lightly-flavoured rice.
We had 3 dishes consisting of Basil Pork (S$7), Green curry chicken (S$9) and Egg with Thai raddish (S$8). My fave has got to be the basil pork! Goes really well with rice! Green curry has plenty of tender chunks of chicken, though a little rich. Egg with Thai raddish is actually scrambled eggs with chai por, nothing too outstanding though.
Round up the meal with a bowl of red ruby (S$3). I am loving this place for its affordable (no service charge and GST!) and yummlicious Thai cuisine! Highly recommended 👍👍",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/41ccdf1a884bbfd03ae1387115_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

The dishes here provide refreshing options, apart from the usual basil minced pork. Do not miss the Beef Paneang, a dish of fork-tender beef cheeks doused in red curry sauce, which is one of their unique dishes. The minced meat omelette is a crowd pleaser as well, essentially a Thai-style Furong omelette - fluffy and packed with meat.

Delivery",,"The Thai food competition is definitely heating up in our sunny island as you can easily find a Thai eatery or restaurant these days, especially when it comes to Thai Issan cuisine that we are all too familiar with.","From the spicy and tangy tom yum soup to stir fry basil pork, these are the staples that have to be included in every Thai menu. However, more and more restaurants are creating unique dishes to cater to a wider audience and at Soi Thai Kitchen, besides the regular clear tom yum, there’s the red tom yum seafood soup which comes with a generous amount of prawns and the garlic pork. The latter is slightly different from the other establishments that serve the same dish as Soi Thai’s version is not the dry kind, which I would have very much preferred. The addition of garlic bits proved to be the saving factor to bring about that punchy garlic flavour. Without it, the entire dish is just too one-dimensional for me.

Delivery",,Tom Yum Soup Lately more Thai stalls are opening up in neighborhood estates.,"Soi Thai at tampines is one of them.. having tried their outlet at Serangoon Gardens before, I decided to give this stall a try. Their Tom Yum soup is pretty good and it's noticeably sweet and although it's spicy, I felt there was some buffer for those who can't really take super hot! Ingredients are pretty typical with a few pieces of prawns. A nice comforting bowl of soup but would prefer if they could serve it in a warmer as it gets cold pretty fast..

Hundred Acre Creamery (Tampines),1 REVIEW,0 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$10/pax,"Desserts
Ice Cream & Yoghurt
Cafes & Coffee
Waffles",,Coconut Pandan Mochi Waffles with Ocean Blue Ice-Cream,"Hundred Acre Creamery is one of the few ice-cream parlours which had sprouted up at Sunset Way at a time where multiple ice-cream / gelato parlours have moved into the neighbourhood. Whilst Dawn’s Gelateria and Cafe had mostly kept its operations within their Sunset Way premises, Burnt Cones on the other hand had expanded their operations to multiple outlets at The Sail @ Marina Bay (within Space) and at NEWest. Whilst Hundred Acre Creamery does share a relationship with Only Creamery at Temple Street, Hundred Acre Creamery had recently opened their second outlet — this time round in the East at Blk 824 Tampines Street 81. Being neighbours with Little Tokio, the space which Hundred Acre Creamery has moved into at Tampines is pretty identical to that of their Sunset Way space — one that is the size of half of a standard HDB shophouse unit, though there seems to be more outdoor seating space at their Tampines outlet as compared to their original space at Sunset Way. The interior decor theme also stays close to the original outlet of Hundred Acre Creamery at Sunset Way — the bright yellow walls, as well as quotes from Winnie The Pooh of which Hundred Acre Creamery had themed itself with; all these has a place in the outlet at Tampines as well. Offering almost the same variety of ice-cream flavours as they have been doing at Sunset Way, patrons can opt for their ice-cream to be had in cups or in their house-made Rosemary Cone; there is also a choice of opting for the Classic Belgian Waffle or the Coconut Pandan Waffle. It is noted that the Dalat (a Vietnamese dessert featuring Coconut Sorbet, Avocado Cream and Toppings) is not being listed on the menu at Hundred Acre Creamery in Tampines; that being said, apart from the usual freshly-brewed tea and Vietnamese drip coffee which they do serve up at Sunset Way, there is an outlet exclusive item of Egg Coffee at their Tampines location.
One thing which we had yet to try at Hundred Acre Creamery after all this while was their Coconut Pandan Mochi Waffles. We had also decided to opt for a scoop of the Ocean Blue Ice-Cream to go along with the Coconut Pandan Mochi Waffles. Reading the description of Ocean Blue Ice-Cream in the display fridge, the Ocean Blue Ice-Cream was described as a flavour which features elements such as white chocolate, Nori (seaweed), and Blue Pea Flower. The elements does sound reminiscent to that of the White Chocolate Nori which Tom’s Palette offer, as well as a similar flavour which we had came across at Wonders at Ang Mo Kio. That being said, the folks at Hundred Acre Creamery made the flavour their very own — for one the version at Hundred Acre Creamery comes with a blue hue that is coloured from the blue pea flower. This version also lacks chunks of white chocolate and nuts, therefore being a smoother and creamier rendition of what Tom’s Palette and Wonders serve up. Whilst sounding weird on paper, the umami notes of the Nori complimented the sweetness from the milk chocolate pretty well — the entire flavour was also not overly sweet as well, and was easy to have. Finally giving their Coconut Pandan Mochi Waffles a go, the Coconut Pandan Mochi Waffles came with a texture that most will come to love. Being all plush and fluffy, the waffle was what one would have expected; crisp on the exterior, but reveals a slightly fluffy and chewy texture. There isn’t a visible slab of mochi hidden within the waffle, but rather just something chewy and sticky within which made the waffle rather light as opposed to those that slap on a thick layer of mochi in between the waffle; the flavours of the Coconut Pandan Mochi Waffles leaning close to that of Ondeh-Ondeh with its noticeable hint of Pandan fragrance accompanied by the drizzle of Gula Melaka around the sides which one can lather onto the waffle.
Hundred Acre Creamery is our favourite ice-cream parlour when it comes to the ones that are located at Sunset Way. What makes Hundred Acre Creamery pretty unique from the other ice-cream / gelato parlours located even in other neighbourhoods is how they seem to make their own ice-cream flavours, as well as how they have incorporated a Vietnamese element into their branding that is pretty atypical of ice-cream / gelato parlours to do. They do have a good spread of fairly interesting flavours back then in the day; apart from the Ocean Blue, there are also flavours such as the Ca Phe — a flavour inspired from Vietnamese filtered coffee that features bold notes that one would associate with Vietnamese Drip Coffee with Milk, and the Honey Chrysanthemum just to name a few. Visiting Hundred Acre Creamery when they had first opened at Sunset Way, it is amazing to see how far they have come — not only with Only Creamery which it had a hand in helping to set up, but also the opening of a second location as well; quite a journey for those who are behind the brand. With promising flavours, quality offerings and a concept that is unique to their very own which is pretty constant to their original space ar Sunset Way, Hundred Acre Creamery is likely a spot that Tampines residents would be glad to have in their neighbourhood; we would still be visiting their Sunset Way outlet since that is their location closest to us, but the Tampines outlet would be the one to head to if we were to be in the East. At this note, we would like to congratulate the folks behind Hundred Acre Creamery on the opening of their new outlet, and wish them all the best in what is to come!",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/1676775755_review_image1962029_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Thought that the snow icing powder, maple syrup, chantilly cream and honey butter all came together very well. I liked how the honey butter added a tad bit of saltiness to the honey lathered pancakes, giving it a bit of a savoury kick and balancing the sweetness. There were only 2 half-strawberries at the side (very sour), which was quite pathetic in my opinion. Overall, this dessert is pretty pricey for what its worth, but I can't deny that the texture of these soufflé pancakes are pretty damn good. Then again, albeit thick looking, there isnt much volume to the pancakes which makes it even look way much more than its worth. This is not the everyday dessert I will return back to, but if you are craving soufflé pancakes and don't mind spending a bit more for well-textured ones, you ought to try fluff stack.

Japanese",,Not Worth The Money,"Ordered the katsu curry rice (lunch special $11.90++) with salmon ($4++ with ocha as a lunch set add-on) and swordfish ($7.90++) sashimi and the aburi salmon roll ($16.90++). The curry is heavy on spice and light on flavor. I ran out of curry before I finished the rice. There's a side salad on the edge of the plate that drinks thousand island dressing into the rice - rice and thousand island dressing do not match in any known universe. The chicken katsu is a chicken breast - nothing wrong if you like chicken breasts but it's neither traditional nor my preference. What was wrong was that it was slightly on the burnt side - as if the chef didn't know that fried goods continue to colour and cook after removal from oil. It's led to a slight bitter edge that could've been balanced by a sweet Japanese curry... oh wait - short on flavor. The aburi salmon roll... it took me three pieces to figure out that the chewiness was a bit of skin that had been left attached to the raw salmon in the roll. It was that or the slightly unripe avocado.
The sashimi was fresh and okay for the price. The rest of it? Not worth it at all.",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/306b219fc82c188546c61780095_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

My favorite - Pan seared sirloin steak (100g/200g $14.90/$28.90) - so juicy & tender!
🥩
My another favorite - thinly sliced Japanese scallop with mentaiko sauce ($14.90) - super good & satisfying!
😋
Deep fried sweet shrimp ($5.90) was a fantastic starter & you could really taste the sweetness
🦐
Sashimi ($29.90) - my all time favorite was salmon! Check out that thick yummy fresh slices! Tuna was good too! Swordfish literally melted upon your bite. Yellowtail was not my preference as I did not like its taste & feel. Sea urchin sushi ($11.90) was an acquired taste that I’d yet to acquire
🍣
Soft shell crab salmon aburi ($18.90) was a yummy roll

My main issue is with the manager, Catherine. Upon entering, I clarified with her on what I could order using BB, to which she verified. After what would have been an alright meal, she retracted on what she earlier told me and said that I couldn’t use my BB on what we have ordered. She then told me that since she had already handed me over to her part-time employee prior to ordering, so it is my fault that I didn’t clarify with her employee.
Weird... I didn’t even bother arguing with her and just paid up. She went on to continue clarifying that she made a mistake but it was my mistake to not ask her part-time employee too. 🤯

From the very first bite, you can taste the fiery tom yum mixture on the chicken chunks that will set your tongue tingling and after a few more spoonful, the spice hits you even harder and I was seen reaching out for the iced Thai milk tea to cool down the heat. Overall, the spice was a good pain that you just couldn’t stop eating more of it. What’s even better is that I managed to score a 30% discount when I used the promo code TUKTUKCHA during checkout and this deal is available now to 13 October.

I have ordered a 🦐combo ($20.95) which included lemon butter white fish and the sides I chose are sweet potato chips and grilled prawns. The serving is quite generous, my most favorite portion. Grilled prawns have tinge of sweetness!

Pepper Lunch (Tampines 1),12 REVIEWS,0 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$15/pax,"Steak
Halal
Japanese",,Australian Beef Pepper Steak (130g),"Went on a saturday dinner time around 6.45pm. Expect long queue during dinner time.. especially during fasting month.
Ordered their Ala Carte Australian Beef Pepper Steak (130g) for $20.90 + one free choice of sauce (Cheese sauce, brown sauce and hickory BBQ sauce). Pretty expensive…
I love cheese so I got the cheese steak sauce but it just taste like store-bought cheese sauce which was eh. This Australian steak is on their premium steak menu but I felt that the steak’s cut was too thin and doesn’t really taste high quality to be honest.. I mean.. couldn’t expect a lot from a lunch express food outlet, so that’s that. They could be more generous with the amount of broccoli too as they gave only 2… On a high note, at least the food came piping hot and taste decent.
Will I come back again in terms of steaks? Not really, there are better options as compared to this. Maybe they are known more for their beef/chicken pepper rice but I stopped ordering that.
From past experience, the portion control was not consistent even though I ordered the jumbo size version but the quantity of meats were not justified.
-1 for waiting time ( waited close to 15 minutes to submit my order as there is only one cashier open… )
-1 for quality

JOFA Meepok (Tampines),5 REVIEWS,8 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$5/pax,Hawker Food,,Signature Minced Meat Noodles | $6,"At $6 you get a bowl of traditional BCM with premium ingredients such as clams, scallop, abalone and handmade prawn balls. Loved the texture of the Mee pok and how it blended with the flavours of the Mee pok, but what I enjoyed the best was the chilli which really gave a spiciness that tingled on your lips even after you’re done. And I love my spice so that really set this bowl of noodles apart for me. The more unique ingredients like the handmade prawn ball was springy and delightful, and together with the soup on the side it was one comforting coffeeshop meal. I do like Jofa’s Meepok, but I can see how the slightly pricier options may turn people off. That being said, they have basic options without these ‘premium’ ingredients at $4.50, so it might still be decently priced for people who want their meepok fix. Best believe they’ll still be one of the options I’d return to.

Customised and made without alkaline for better texture, their perfectly-cooked meepok stood out significantly for me. As the soup given at the side didn’t quite impress, I’d highly recommend getting their dry chilli version instead. Oh btw, you can actually ask for free soup refills…😂
For just SGD1.50 more, you can get a variety of fresh seafood toppings, which I honestly think is value for money. Special mention goes to the succulent mock abalone that packs a nice punch of sweetness.😋

The noodles are well done with good texture and firm bite. Although the seafood are frozen, it was still plump and sweet. The prawn paste balls were crunchy and tender.

It's the little details that make a dish, and here the humble ikan bilis deserves mention too - freshly fried, delicately crisp and well seasoned with salt.

Nestled at a kopitiam in Tampines Industrial Park, this is the Nasi Lemak Stall that blew up in popularity sometime back last year. Its claim to fame is their Lobster Nasi Lemak - a twist from the iconic Malay dish.
。
The show-stealing lobster definitely failed at its job. The meat didn’t come off from the shell easily and was slightly mushy. Though it was well-seasoned and tasty, it didn’t bring out that fresh crustacean taste. Priced at $22, I feel that the portion of lobster meat was pretty underwhelming too. The only saving grace was probably their homemade sambal sauce which suits my taste buds and spicy tolerance level 😂.

Currently the benchmark for good and affordable messy bread- I am finally impressed by one of the most accessible bakeries in Singapore. The selected variant was a solid Danish pastry with sweet lemon custard and an excessive amount of powdered sugar over a white chocolate spread. Another option is the messy bread (matcha/Milo) thats pure bread instead of Danish-pastry.
Overall my sweet tooth was pleased and I am still surprised by the layered Danish pastry that I tasted- was not expecting such standards from the bakery but I was glad to be proven wrong!",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/3768ef0eb7ca840090e1628050_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Western",,NZ Striploin 250g Steakhouse chargrilled medium rare with parmesan asparagus and cream parmesan spinach.,"Booked reservation on a public holiday dinner time.
Placed is not fully packed but decent amount of people.
We ordered the AU Ribeye 200g Chargrilled medium rare with baked potato and chopped green salad and NZ Striploin 250g Steakhouse Chargrilled medium rare with parmesan asparagus and cream parmesan spinach. Both of the dishes arrived around 25-30 minutes.
The cut was cooked to perfection with the juiciness of the meat still intact and the marbling is visibly clear. The meat is not too tough and decently tender. Although the fat of the meat can be tough to chew as it requires 10-15 times.
I like the asparagus as it is crunchy and the seasoning of the flavour is just right. The cream spinach was slightly off and wasn’t to my liking. I will probably skip that next time.
The ribeye was juicy and decent amount of fat to meat ratio. The potato could be softer as it is quite hard. The salad is not bad, refreshing and light. It comes nicely together with the sauce.
Overall, it is value for money whenever you want to get your steak fix as you are paying for a decent steak with an affordable price point.
Will definitely revisit again 😊
P.S one of the waiter recorded one of the side dish wrongly and I immediately sound out to them. They were quick to react to ensure that they do not cook the wrong cut of steak (which in this case it is not). Good job in terms of their service.
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/5
-1 for baked potato (hard) and cream spinach (not to personal preference)",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/1690569550_review_image1973653_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Western",,Pepper Chicken W/ 2 Sides | $10.50,"Black pepper chicken with buttered corn kernel and cauliflower cheese.
The chicken is nothing much to shout about, it is of fair standard where you can find in places like astons, and maybe even in coffee shops as well.
Meanwhile, the cauliflower was a little bit too hard for my liking, and the cheese just does not go well with it.

Western",,Value For Money Steak!,"Finally, all of us Upper East Siders (=Tampines and Pasir Ris) can rejoice with the newly opened iSteaks (@isteaksdiner) at Tampines One. For $24, you can get a 250g NZ ribeye with two complimentary sides. The choices for the sides are aplenty, including mac & cheese, sautéed brussel sprouts, parmesan asparagus, creamed spinach, etc. The steak was nicely grilled, although my medium rare steak did tend to be borderline medium doneness.
.
They have also adopted the self-ordering system, where you scan a QR code and place your order and pay online. Many restaurants have adopted this system, saving on labour cost and time, but somehow after a while, I do feel that eating out at these places is no longer as exciting simply because there is no more interaction between the staff and customers. The platform interface for iSteak was also pretty confusing, so I was indeed a bit irritated at the start. They probably need to fine tune the ordering platform in time to come, but if you want a good, value for money steak anytime, head on to iSteaks.

Ordered the Coffee & Matcha flavoured Dalgona under the 1-for-1 deal. Both drinks were really fragrant & flavourful. The staff were friendly as well! Will definitely be back to try other flavours as it’s definitely worth the price.

Beyond Exclusive Deals",,A good cup of coffee!,"Honestly, I wouldn't think of getting coffee from this cafe in tampines 1, but thanks to burpple beyond, I found another good coffee place!
We got the Dalgona coffee ($7.90 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and we were surprised that it isn't too sweet! The coffee beans used is very fragrant, neither too acidic nor too bitter, and the dalgona or caramelised sugar did add a earthy caramel flavour to the coffee. Coffee is thick but not too milky. A pretty good cup of coffee indeed!",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/1662180884_review_image1949528_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Perhaps Macs confused matcha and jasmine? I’d take their regular soft serve vanilla cone at $0.80 anytime over this.",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/531333e077e7d50fd601637833_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Don’t judge, but it was my first time eating MacGriddles and it was..... n’t as fantastic as I had expected. The buns were a big too soaked with maple syrup for my liking and i still prefer sausage McMuffin over this. 😳 Think I’m one of the few who felt this way about McGriddles. Hurhur.

It was a good catchup w Looo tho! Felt like I hadn’t seen/ spoke to you for a long long time. The last time we properly talked was when we were sitting inside the platform of Bedok reservoir station. Love you Loo! ♥️

$7.30 for 6-inch, $12.30 for footlong

The new sub comes with rendang sauce; which Subway took months of R&D to perfect
.
Rendang sauce made from a medley of ingredients which include chilli, onion, tumeric, ginger, garlic, desiccated coconut, tamarind, lemongrass and an unique spice and herb mixture
.
Personally, I felt that the chicken were moist and absorbs the flavour of the rendang better. Thus with each mouthful, I got hit with a spice flavour explosion

Personally, I felt that the beef was kinda dry and didn’t really absorb the flavour of the rendang

.
BK’s signature Tendercrisp fried chicken patty slathered with their house-made laksa sauce (made from dried shrimp), sliced hard boiled eggs, cucumbers and sandwiched between two sesame seed buns
.
The laksa sauce was rather salty and spicy in my opinion
.
Both the sliced hard boiled eggs and cucumbers added a bit of crunchiness and depth to the burger
.
And as I take each bite of the burger, the laksa sauce got even spicier and made me sweat a bit
.
*Recommended to order a value set meal in case you can’t take the spicy laksa sauce

I must say, I still love it with just rice. Simple yet the focus of flavour is in the char siew. Apparently the wonton didn't do justice to the dish. It was just all wrapper and the filling hardly can be seen. Some more, overcooked. Sigh. Anyway the noodles were tender yet still have firm bite. And the char siew was edible enough for me to finish.
This was my dinner last night but because quite frustrating, I was not in the mood to post. HAHA 😄

I didn't know what to eat. A lot of choices -- prata, fried chicken, chicken rice -- endless choices. But I was attracted to this stall, Ding Ji. The Signature Noodle has the biggest picture, so, I thought, ""Why not try is one?"" 💭
It was filling because of the generous ingredients. But aside from that, there is not much to shout about. The noodles were sticking together that made it difficult to take out using chopsticks (Not an expert in chopsticks 😒). However, it was not as bad. If you're just looking for something edible and can last you until evening, this can be in your choices. 😜

3 layers of cheesecake icecream, 2 crunches - crunchy muesli and cornflakes duo biscuit, 2 fruits - strawberry and mango & 1 black chocolate sauce • $7.95 [topped up $1 for the cheesecake icecream]
Was surprised that yolé, after replacing llaollao, came up with so many different yogurt flavours and even icecream now!! This is not my first time trying yolé products, my first try was the strawberry froyo and that hit the mark for me. The cheesecake icecream had a mild cheese taste, which wasn’t too heavy on the palate and had a smooth and creamy texture. The only problem i had was that the icecream melted fast than usual, same goes for their froyo as well, they really need to improve on that. Had to eat the icecream quickly sadly, couldn’t take the time to savour it slowly or else it’ll just be a puddle of cheesecake icecream. When i ate it together with the black chocolate sauce i didn’t really taste the cheesecake much as it overpowers the taste so i don’t really recommend the sauce. However, i absolutely love the crunchy muesli though, it went pretty well with it.
Overall, it was a great dessert still, and very filling as well. Do try it out if you pass by, cause this cheesecake flavour is limited edition, don’t miss it !!",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/2f1da177d00f78c7352c1637565_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Japanese",,Pork Shabu Tom Yam Ramen | $12,"A decent bowl of fusion ramen by Japanese ramen chain, Ajisen; though I probably would not patronise them for this again.
Ajisen’s ramen over the years remain unimpressive. It is difficult to criticise because the elements of this ramen was straight to the point. The pork shabu came in moderate amounts; the Tom yam flavour was not too salty, sour, nor spicy; the texture of ramen noodles is what you’d expect. Yet, none of these were mindblowing, and for the price, there is a higher chance of getting a bowl of similar standards at a cheaper price, or something arguably of better quality at a similar price.
Nonetheless, ajisen remains a relatively affordable ramen fix in shopping malls, and they serve other dishes such as fried rice and gyoza as well, which may fare better than this bowl of ramen.

This drink however went Super well with the sesame pearls! Matcha and sesame combination always works out, and it worked out perfectly for this drink too.

However, I would prefer the tea to be paired with a more savoury pearl like sesame, as the chrysanthemum pearls made it too sweet for my liking. Considering that I ordered 0% sugar, the sweetness was still bearable for me though. Nonetheless love playmade for its interesting pearls!

Tried their Chrysanthemum Milk Tea with Chrysanthemum Pearls ($3.90) and the milk tea was just overpowering with the taste of sweet chrysanthemum (not a bad thing) despite choosing 30% sugar and the pearls didn’t really have a chrysanthemum taste to it. I tried the pearls both with the tea and without to try to taste something in the pearls.

ordered another chocolate latte w white pearls (not pictured) and it was not bad as well. the slight taste of bitter cocoa is there and tasted not bad overall!
pearl wise: chewy yet doesn’t tire you from all the chew 🌚
would like to try their pink cactus pearls one day!! All their pearls are freshly made and only with natural ingredients!!
verdict: 8/10
damage: 7/10 (could be quite pricy for a cup of drink with ‘unique’ flavoured pearls)
However i would go back to buy again as a lot of their drinks sounds refreshing and worthy to try!!
btw their service is pretty good/friendly, as i bought it when they newly opened, the boss approached each customer queuing and explained more about their bubble tea/pearl making process + made recommendations to us. upon ordering the staff was kind enough to inform you of the recommend sugar lvl as well. even when i forgot to let her know i didn’t want ice after ordering for some time, they still managed to give me mine without ice.

I initially wanted to get my Burnt Caramel Milk Tea with Burnt Caramel pearls but it was sold out (update: a friend of mine tried it and said that it tasted very much like regular pearls) so I got the White pearls instead, hoping to find something comparable to Gongcha’s.
Verdict: meh. You’d probably get something better from Koi for this price. The white pearls tasted and felt like regular pearls too.
On the other hand, my friend made a cheaper and better choice. He mixed pearls! His Taiwan Green Milk Tea was not out of this world fantastic (but still better than mine) and the Sesame pearls were, much to my amazement, SUPER GOOD!??!!? I felt like too much of it will be super jelak but he begged to differ and it was his drink so verdict goes to him I guess? 🤷🏻‍♀️

I was near to Expo and since Tampines was only 4 stops away with the new DTL3 (seats featured in the background, haha), I decided to go down to Playmade after hearing so much about their specially flavoured pearls that are made every hour. I have to say, that it was really quite disappointing, particularly since it's nowhere near where I stay. Moreover, the queue was really long, with 20 people in front of me, and I queued for over 35 minutes. (I felt that they were quite understaffed, but the shop was also really small, so I guess it's understandable.)
Their milk tea is normal- nothing particularly distinctive. I chose the sesame pearls, burnt caramel pearls, and pink cactus pearls. Maybe it was because the pearls were mixed, but the only type of pearls with any distinct taste was the sesame one - it was a bit nutty and bordering on savoury, and I quite enjoyed it. But other than that, the other pearls tasted normal, which was quite a pity.",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/5bc6ac961f8f894062a1579626_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Absolutely loved the pretty and refreshing Grapefruit Yakult Green Tea ($9.10)🍊🥛, which came with real fruit pulp and had a hint of the bitterness of fresh grapefruit. 50% sugar was just perfect for this, paired with the mildly sweet Pink Cactus Pearls. 💝 (Aka a more atas sounding version of 龙珠果 Dragon Fruit, and tastes a bit like Bandung 🌷😝) Would have loved this drink to have a creamier depth to it, perhaps with yogurt instead of Yakult? And also, I like my grapefruits slightly bitter so I'll go for 30% sugar the next time. 👍🏻🍊
We also tried the Honey Green Tea with Black Sesame Pearls. ($5.10) 🖤 I'm not a black sesame fan, but the pearls were packed with flavours and went well paired with the lightly fragranced tea!
I'd definitely come back again to try the burnt caramel latte with burnt caramel pearls! But as for the grapefruit drink... Maybe once in a blue moon, cos' $9.10 for a cuppa bubble tea??!

Keep to your chrysanthemum, pink catcus pearls, they are so much better. Even the previous peach 🍑 pearls was so good.

OK I totally forgot I was on a less sugar, less milk diet AND WENT TO ORDER @playmadeonezo bbt 😂😂⠀
It’s alright. New week, new me (hopefully)⠀
.⠀
Eastie friend recommended this place and I tried:⠀
1) Burnt Caramel Milk Tea with Sesame Pearl. Kinda sweet but I like it! Definitely better than normal caramel milk teas out there. The sesame pearl was OK but a bit too tough for my liking.⠀
2) Green Milk Tea. Very nice! The green tea takes away the bloated-gelatness of the milk tea; makes it taste refreshing.⠀
.⠀
Conclusion - pls come to the west side. Will order this over #koi any day.⠀
ALSO FEEL FREE TO RECOMMEND ME SOME OTHER BUBBLE TEA 😍😍⠀

The fish fillet is wrapped in a crispy yet thin batter. As you bite into the batter, you can hear the crisp of it. (Hear it crunch in your mouth) Beneath the fried batter lies the soft off-white fish flesh that melts in your mouth. The inner fish flesh has a smooth and delicate texture to it, providing a nice contrast. Crispy outside, delicate inside. (Imagine the moment it transitions from crunchy crispy fried fish batter into soft, delicate fish flesh) The lemon and signature tartar sauce adds a refreshing acidic twist and oceanic sweetness to the mildly salty fish. (Pair it with the complement sauces and feel the tantalizing sensation on your taste buds) The coleslaw, a traditional cold salad topped with mayonnaise brings the temperature to the extremes, the fusion of hot and cold. (Like Burning Lava Cake with Frozen Ice Cream)

Western",,When You Can't Have The Best Of Both Worlds,"Honey Avocado ($13.50): The serving size of the Avocado paste is rather generous. Spread it with the knife and you can easily cover the entire surface of the ciabatta bread.
Perhaps I ordered this on the day when the Chef just found love. The proportion of the Avocado and Honey is definitely unbalanced, with the latter part overshadowing the poor avocado. Doesnt help that the avocado was mashed beyond any recognizable texture when you bite into it
The idea of mixing and avocado sounds plausible, but hope that the sweetness cam be controlled",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/4d135d8b4fe30cedaa81713177_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Chicken was crispy (reminds me a little of kfc, only better), tender and juicy. Could do with more honey (which was a great idea). Didn't like that the buttered potatoes were served cold.

My friends and I decided to have a buffet meal to celebrate since it was so long time ago that we're together again, complete in one table! 👭👭 We were so excited and so as planned, enjoy and eat till you can hahaha 😋.
Seoul Garden offers grill and steamboat type of buffet. The variety of food was few compare to other buffet restaurants that I've tried and I don't know if it was really like this since it was my first time. I expect more beef meats but it what was offered was more on chicken meats of different marinate (garlic, satay, etc.) Choices of gunkan's and maki's was a bit 🍣 I'm looking for tempura but they don't have 🤔. My two friends tried their shrimp pasta but they say it was bland. For our steamboat soup we chose thai tom yam and chicken soup. Seafood selection was few also I don't know maybe the branch in tampines was that small?
I think the best part only was their dessert especially the chocolate mango cake👍. They also had chendol which you will make your own, cheesecake, matcha flavor, etc.
Maybe we will try a different branch of Seoul Garden to see if there's a difference on variety of food. Overall we just enjoy cooking, eating, laughing and the best was happiness that were complete this day! 😍

Halal",*Halal-certified,Sichuan Style Fried Eggplants ($9.90),"Came to Delibowl X Nuodle at Tampines Hub with 0 expectations but this Sichuan Style Fried Eggplant [$9.90] sucker punched me all the way back to my time in Barcelona where I first tasted (and inadvertently fell in love with fried eggplants). Served freshly fried and glazed, these crunchy shards of eggplant came drizzled in a dark sticky sauce and sprinkled with sesame seeds. A closer look reveals pieces of fried garlic, dried chilli, spring onion, and of course, Sichuan peppercorns.
When you bite into the first piece, the crunch takes you by surprise. It’s a combination of the crispy exterior thanks to the hot oil but also the caramelising of what I believe to be a sweet dark soy sauce. Then you get the fragrance of the aforementioned aromatics before the creamy eggplant rounds these punchy flavours and textures into the perfect bite. All while it was hot! Absolutely fantastic, and unpretentiously delicious.
I find myself scavenging the bowl for bits of fried garlic and peppercorn and wow, what a delightful dish from start to end. I will definitely come back and I can only wish that it lives up to this first appearance.",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/3b1b0d71559e8ea75c61826850_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Pictured is the level 4 Extra Spicy 特辣 level and I dare say that the spiciness will burn while still having the aroma of the mala spices. The fries are tossed in a mala seasoning and the wings are coated with a spicy numbing sauce.
Available for delivery and takeaways via the Pizza Hut’s website or mobile application, the Chinese New Year specials can be ordered ala carte or in meal sets. There are other irresistible deals such as 50%OFF pizza to check out.
To toast to an auspicious Lunar New Year, Pizza Hut will also be giving out a BIG Angbao $888 to a lucky winner each week for 3 weeks. Look out for HUAT opportunities on Pizza Hut's social media channels and you might just be one of the three lucky winners to win $888!

Hawaiian Supreme ($9.90)
We were rather sceptical with the Hawaiian Supreme at first but still decided to go with it for the (insta)gram. Honestly, more cheese and ham sounds excessive but once we had our first bite we realized that more cheese and ham really makes a difference! Their Creamy Cheese Drizzle taste similar, if not exact, to the Nacho sauce KFC serves. The difference in price for Hawaiian and Hawaiian Supreme personal pan is only $0.40 but you get almost double the ingredients. We would gladly choose Hawaiian Supreme anyday!
•
Seafood Vongole ($13.90)
Seafood was fresh, pasta was al dente but the broth was weird so we didn't enjoy this! Kae had to add extra extra serving of pepper and chilli flakes to cover the taste of the broth which was far from the sweet and savoury as mentioned.

Wanted to try as I saw quite a number of people around the Kopitiam eating this! There’s not much queue here because there’s only a few set options on the menu and they serve pretty fast.
I like that the set comes with quite a few things - meat, egg and vege! Chicken meat served were all thigh, so meat is really tender and portion is good too! Asked for more sauce, which they gladly and generously gave me too, and we even agreed this type of rice is nicer with more gravy 😂
Recommend! Next time, I want to try grilled fish!

Chinese",,"Get spiced up with Tim Ho Wan’s new seasonal menu, the Hong Kong Curry Signatures; dishes that are paired with the mildly spiced gravy with a creamy sweet profile from the herbs and spices.","As coconut milk is used in the curry gravy, it has a certain richness and aroma that is different from the other curries out there. There are a total of four dishes in this menu from snacks to mains, such as the Fried Curried Crabmeat Taro Puffs to Fried Curried Chicken Potato Buns, HK Curry Pork Chop Egg Fried Rice and HK Curry Beef Brisket Rice Rolls. Out of the four, my favourites would be the puffs and buns as both had the crispy outer texture and curry filling in the inside. Whilst the pork chop was nicely marinated, the egg fried rice lacked the wok hei aroma, otherwise it would easily be my top choice.

Chinese",,Celebrate the Lunar New Year with Tim Ho Wan’s Auspicious Blossom Series of 5 seasonal festive dishes.,"The five dishes include the Wild Caught Canadian Lobster and Shrimp Fried Radish Cake ($18.80), newly launched Crab Meat & Flying Fish Roe Fried Rice ($13.80), Deep Fried Century & Salted Egg Sesame Prawn Roll ($7.50), steamed treats of Golden Custard & Yam Crystal Dumplings ($6.50) and sweet desserts of Pan-fried Water Chestnut Cake & Nian Gao ($6).
The wok-fried radish cake comes with plump lobster claw meat and shrimp while the fried rice has lots of texture from the egg, crab meat and generous topping of tobiko. The steamed dumplings are something that you should try as inside the delicate chewy skin is a sweet milk custard or orh-nee paste. Since it is the new year season, there will be the chewy nian gao and crunchy water chestnut cake.
These dishes are available as ala carte orders or you can get the Auspicious Blossom Taster Set for 2 pax at $53 nett that is exclusive on delivery platforms (link below). If you are ordering for a bigger group, you can also consider the Auspicious Blossom CNY Huat Set at $88++ which feeds 3 to 4 pax that comes with a collection of 10 CNY specials and dim sum with 4 beverages included, available for dine-in and takeaway at all Tim Ho Wan outlets.

Kimly Dim Sum (Tampines Street 21),2 REVIEWS,1 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$5/pax,"Dim Sum
Hawker Food",,Kimly Dim Sum,"🍽️ Siu Mai $1.80 and Har Gao $2 @ Kimly Handmade Tim Sum
♨️ The Siu Mai is what you can expect from $0.60 a piece price point. It is considered really affordable. It taste like a dense meatball. Traditionally, the Siu mai will be topped with some fish roe, but given its price point, they used colour sago to replace it. Anyway that is just for decoration purpose, it will not really affect the flavour profile.
🍤 The Har Gao aka shrimp dumpling is a little disappointing. The skin is ok thin but the shrimp isn't fresh. The shrimp has broken into pieces within the dumpling itself instead of staying in one piece.

The char siew (barbecue pork) was sweet and tender, and the silky noodles were coated in a glossy oil and sauce mixture that made it extra sinful. The portion of wanton (dumplings) was small but packed with flavour, and every bite was guaranteed to leave a satisfyingly greasy feel in the mouth.
Though it was good, it didn't quite reach the ""wow"" factor for me. Perhaps my expectations were set too high, but overall, it was still a tasty bowl of wanton mee that hit the spot.

We bought from the father's stall (#01-17) and decided to order the large serving of black carrot cake! The large serving was only $4.50 but it had a very generous serving of radish cake and eggs and surprisingly, there was more-than-expected cai por in the dish too.
Do note that for the black carrot cake, the taste of the eggs and radish are a lot less obvious as they are generally overpowered by the sweetness of the dark soya sauce. However, we really like the sweetness of the dish. For those of you who really want to taste the radish cake, we suggest you get the white carrot cake instead, which is priced the same and seems to be more popular among the breakfast crowd.
One thing to note if you are planning to order the spicy version is that their chilli is rather spicy. Hence, you may wish to tell them to reduce the spice level if your tolerance for spicy food isn't that high. 😰",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/1654329621_review_image1940538_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Tampines Round Market & Food Centre,155 REVIEWS,84 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$10/pax,Hawker Food,,There are many disappearing dishes in our F&B scene that the future generations will not have the chance to try and one of them is appam.,"Appam is a fermented rice pancake that’s served with orange palm sugar and is usually eaten for breakfast or as a snack. Fortunately, there’s one stall at Tampines Round Market & Food Centre that you can get them at Rajarani Thosai (Stall 01-33) which only charges $1 for a single portion. The batter which is used to make the appam contains fermented rice and coconut milk which you can taste a mixture of tanginess and savouriness from each bite together with the sweetness from the palm sugar. Another stall which I discovered during my trip there was 第11 街 Fish Soup which was a hidden gem as the sliced batang fish was tender to the bite while the soup packs an umami punch, not the ones that are loaded with MSG kind, with a sour note from the tomatoes in it. If you are at this food centre, do consider dabao-ing from these places for your meal.

Our Tampines Hub Hawker Centre,119 REVIEWS,37 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$5/pax,Hawker Food,,IPPON Dry Ramen (⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️),"Good food doesn't have to be expensive, just like this Ippon Dry Ramen from IPPON @ippon_fusion_bowl! Crowned with a generous portion of green scallions, pickled vegetables, black fungus, and minced pork stew, the bed of ramen tucked underneath had a decent QQ bite and absorbed the rich broth from the pork stew. Poke through the onsen egg in the centre and let the noodles soak up the creamy molten yolk. The lightly grilled chashu slices were tender and well-braised with their in-house recipe. While most mazesoba/dry ramen places serve sliced pork of similar style & quality, it's interesting to note that the chashu skin here is a bit jelly-like. Lowkey wish there were more pieces cos I enjoyed them!

The best part? This bowl only costs $6.50 - a relatively cheaper option for mazesoba while tasting just as good. If ramen's not your thing, they also offer affordable donburi bowls that won't break the bank!

The porridge also comes with youtiao, which we advise to eat before mixing into the porridge as the youtiao becomes soggy thereafter!
The fish porridge contains the same fish usually used in 鱼片米粉 and the fish didn't have the fishy taste, which was a plus for us! However, the fish porridge is one of the more expensive items on the menu, costing $4.50, which is even more expensive than the mixed porridge! We always add another 50 cents for the egg as well, although we were slightly disappointed that the egg yolk was broken this time round!
Try not to visit the stall too late if you want to try the porridge, as there have been ocassions where we went at 9 pm to find the porridge already sold out. 😭",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/2f33ba11f0be831ba6be1923633_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Our Tampines Hub Hawker Centre,119 REVIEWS,37 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$5/pax,Hawker Food,,Mixed Porridge,"The porridge from Botak Delicacy is one of our favourite porridge stalls in Singapore!! 😁 We love the porridge here because it has been cooked until it is very soft, and in fact, you cannot even see the individual grains of rice! The porridge comes with a pretty generous serving of youtiao as well, which is really crispy and we always finish the youtiao before eating the porridge otherwise the youtiao will get soggy.
The ingredients for the mixed porridge are also very generous. You get fish, meatballs, cuttlefish and pig liver in your porridge for only $4! For an additional 50 cents, you can add an egg which we always do as well! The stall cooks the egg in a pretty unique way - the egg white is poured into the pot for cooking, and the cooked porridge is poured over the egg yolk which is left in the bowl. Hence, do ensure that the porridge covers the egg yolk in order to cook it a little!
The stall is open till at least 9 pm at night, although there is a chance that the porridge might sell out before then! Hence, go early and get the porridge for breakfast or lunch if you want to enjoy this warm delight!",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/2f33ba11c3523b38a3fc1916147_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

In the thick and umami-packed broth, there was some dried shrimp, vegetables and fishcake, as well as plenty of fried shallots.

A closer look reveals pieces of fried garlic, dried chilli, spring onion, and of course, Sichuan peppercorns.
When you bite into the first piece, the crunch takes you by surprise. It’s a combination of the crispy exterior thanks to the hot oil but also the caramelising of what I believe to be a sweet dark soy sauce. Then you get the fragrance of the aforementioned aromatics before the creamy eggplant rounds these punchy flavours and textures into the perfect bite. All while it was hot! Absolutely fantastic, and unpretentiously delicious.
I find myself scavenging the bowl for bits of fried garlic and peppercorn and wow, what a delightful dish from start to end. I will definitely come back and I can only wish that it lives up to this first appearance. (I cannot seem to find the Geo-tag for this restaurant.

.
Oven baked with fresh banana slices, sweet pandan kaya, topped with cheese and sprinkled with icing sugar
.
The crust was light and buttery
.
I could taste the rich coconut flavour from the pandan kaya. Also the bananas added an interesting approach to the kaya. They gave the kaya a slightly fruiter taste
.
The addition of icing sugar gave a little extra sweetness to this dessert pizza. And it’s already too sweet for my liking
.
Perhaps tone down the sweetness level in the future

There is always a feel-good-factor from eating such comfort food especially when its piping hot and there’s a bowl of white rice in front of you. Besides the signature dishes such as the sesame chicken ($5.80/$7.80) that’s cooked with ginger and spring onion to the healthy and nutritious chicken herbal soup ($6.80/$9.00), there are also other options with offals, fish, vegetables and seafood. However, there is one particular dish that I will highly recommend as we have been ordering it over the past few times is the Mala Chicken Mix ($8.80), which contains items such as enoki mushrooms, black fungus, tofu sheets and chicken cubes cooked in a spicy mala broth over a claypot.

Delivery",,Are you ready for the #GrabFoodFeastival?,"From now to 15 Dec, GrabFood has 50% off deals across multiple brands to offer!
•
I managed to grab this deal from A-One Claypot House as they are having the 50% off promotion for two sets of their Century Egg Minced Meat Porridge ($12.73, UP $25.46). With the weather starting to turn for the colder, having a bowl of porridge is always comforting and belly warming. What’s different with A-One as compared to the regular congee/porridge is that the porridge is cooked in a claypot to maintain the optimal quality of the ingredients. What’s more, the porridge contains dried scallop which brings about a certain brininess and umami from each mouthful. This is further elevated with the addition of century egg and minced meat for a satisfying and fulfilling meal.

Between the two, I very much prefer this as it doesn’t burn as much, but yet still bring a manageable spicy kick. Paired with coconut rice, fried peanuts & anchovies, fried egg and their homemade sambal sauce, this is a very enjoyable lunch for me today.

Halal",,They are definitely not kidding you when they put 3 chillies beside the Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang dish in the menu when the other variations only had 1 or 2.,"As it is my first time trying such a dish, I ordered their signature and namesake, the Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang ($6.80) which comes with a grilled chicken leg topped with the taliwang sambal and accompanying the meat is coconut rice that has been infused with lemongrass, a fried egg and fried anchovies with peanuts. Another surprising fact is that there is also a scoop of a different kind of sambal by the side, which is more towards the sweet-spicy variation. Everything in this plate works harmoniously with the nicely marinated and charred chicken with the coconuty fragrant rice that has been elevated with lemongrass and the all important sambals. Will definitely be back to try their Ayam Belado and especially the Ayam Cabe Ijo.

The char siew (barbecue pork) was sweet and tender, and the silky noodles were coated in a glossy oil and sauce mixture that made it extra sinful. The portion of wanton (dumplings) was small but packed with flavour, and every bite was guaranteed to leave a satisfyingly greasy feel in the mouth.
Though it was good, it didn't quite reach the ""wow"" factor for me. Perhaps my expectations were set too high, but overall, it was still a tasty bowl of wanton mee that hit the spot.

While I’m a fan of Hjh Maimunah and this review might be biased 😬 In any case, I did have a 50-50 experience to this meal.
Let’s start with the good: I loved the begedil. It was slightly crispy (though it could be crispier) on the outside and tender on the inside. When I took a bite it was packed with flavour likely from the spices. Definitely worth adding to any nasi padang! The ikan bilis was not as crispy so that was a tad sad. The sambal goreng could have been a little spicer but i’m not complaining.
The bad: the most disappointing was the towgay which was quite bitter - mmmm. I wonder if anyone had a similar experience 🤔

What I usually will go for is their yearly creations for the Ultimate Hawker Fest, but this time round, included a prata plaster and kosong. We usually will dine in at the restaurant but because of the current situation, this meal was delivered and the prata kosong surprisingly, remained crispy and took me by surprise. It was not soaked in oil while having a crispness that’s borderline addictive, which I regretted only gotten one of it. The next time I’m ordering from Springleaf, a prata kosong (or maybe two) will definitely be part of the order again.

An after thought: Gokuku is great at making classic pairing work don’t they? Matcha and white chocolate, butter and sugar taken up a notch with raisin and walnuts.
Pro tip 1: if you can’t differentiate the flour variants the bakery use, just spot the description chewy if you’d like a dense chewy bun versus regular fresh fluffy buns, both are equally good and depends on the mood of the day.

Finally! The stall was closed for the whole of Ramadan/ Hari Raya period.
There is usually a short queue on weekends, but it moves fast.
One reason I like this stall is because they make your order fresh. I really don’t like being served thosai that has been lying around for a while/ cold.

Vegetarian",,For Yummy Thosai and Appam,"After eating her way through Tampines Round Market, Tastemaker Wei Zhi Chiang declares Rajarani Thosai to be her favourite stall — that must say something about it! As its name suggests, Rajarani serves up some incredible thosai (a savoury South Indian pancake). Go for the Masalah Thosai ($3), which is soft in the middle and nicely crisp around the edges (to be honest, the Tastemakers wish it were crispier!). The spiced potato filling is generous and tasty, and according to Tastemaker Wei Zhi, it will not scare off non-spicy lovers. On the other hand, Tastemaker Vanessa Kou was won over by the Appam (fermented rice pancake, $1) with its ""crispy edges and pancake-like middle that carries a slight tang from the fermented batter"". It's best enjoyed dipped into the accompanying orange sugar.

Vegetarian",,Masala Thosai ($3),"Have been to Tampines Round Market for a couple of times, but I've never tried this and glad we got to! Masalah Thosai ($3) was one of my favourite dish of the day, could be more crisped but then again it could be because it sat at our table for a bit. Even so, it was still rather crisp at the sides and soft; and the fillings were so tasty! Another off their menu which caught our eyes was the cheese one but we didn't get to try. Warrants another visit!

Vegetarian",,Masala Thosai ($3),"I remember the first time trying thosai was back in primary school, where cheese thosai cost me only $0.60 a piece and I'd always run to the thosai stall once the recess bell rings to be first in line.
15 years later, I'm trying out RajaRani's Masala Thosai, which reminds me much of what I had back in primary school & the best part, with masala!
With slight hints of spice mixed with potatoes, the masala adds a nice touch to the thosai, without being too overbearing. If you're a lover of spice, dip into either of the accompanying curries & you're in for a good feast!

Vegetarian",,Masalah Thosai [$3],"We tried out many stalls and dishes in Tampines Round Market but this was my favorite find here! Though not as crispy as we wanted, it was done evenly throughout, soft in the middle and slightly crispier around the ends. The masalah filling was generous and tasty, with a good amount of spice that won't scare off non-spicy diners. If you don't fancy Masalah, choose from other ingredients like egg, cheese, butter, etc. If only this is nearer to me! #BurppleBestofTampines

Vegetarian",,"In the mood for something sweet, savoury, soft and crispy?","Rajarani Thosai’s Appam ($1) served with the orange sugar is just the thing. Made from rice flour, the texture is exactly what you would expect with the crispy edges and pancake like middle that carries a slight tang from the fermented batter. And don’t leave the queue without buying their thosai. Though a plain thosai will certainly get the job done, their potato masalah ($3) has the right amount of spices. Not spicy but balanced in flavour and went superbly well with the condiments.

The naan was fluffy and soft on the inside but crispy and toasty on the outside. Portion is big (as seen in picture, that's actually one piece of naan being cut into two).
The Butter Chicken's gravy was extremely rich, creamy and savoury. It came with at least six chunks of chicken meat which was surprisingly tender. Anyway don't judge a book by its cover. The bowl may look small but it was sufficient enough to be shared among 2 pax. And although it may look pretty red, it is only mildly spicy and it goes really well with the naan.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COMBINATION.",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/61d5c6f1d04ee35ddf21566169_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Their bestselling Double Flavoured Hor Fun ($15) tops off regular hor fun with a deep-fried version. And an awesome side I rec you pair that with is their Crispy Deep Fried Pork with Garlic ($12), which is battered pieces of pork, and cloves of deep-fried garlic. It sounds pretty straightforward, but your first bite into a piece of pork is full of umami goodness. It's crispy on the outside, with a distinct, garlicky fragrance. Inside, it is tender, juicy, and very deliciously fatty. The garlic cloves are neither pungent nor dry after deep-frying. With their house-made belacan that is tangy, and a little spicy, this side dish would go well with rice too. If you can’t get enough of it though, Jin Hock Seafood sells larger portions at $18 and $24.",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/5c391452de580bd17a41659192_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Though I am not sure to ask for more ingredients than the vegetables, sliced pork and La La, but I was extremely pleased with this delicacy.
The small portion is sold at S$15.00, and could be shared among 2 to 4 pax.",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/598dc594826aba6d64a1653571_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Zi Char",,Milky Fried Abalone Mushroom | 12bucks,"Back at my favourite zichar spot to try other drool-worthy offerings from their menu.
This is actually the 奶黄鲍鱼菇 which should translate to “Buttered Abalone Mushrooms”. A fantastic combination of sweet and savoury, enhanced with the fragrance of curry leaves; reminded us very much of curry-flavoured Twisties in a good nostalgic way. The fried batter retains its crispness well, coupled with the slight sponginess of the thinly sliced mushroom in the middle.
So good, we ordered another plate to snack on right after our meal.",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/41b2d9e8b3ce88c88b81627623_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Zi Char",,Double Flavoured Hor Fun ($15),"Zichar gets a creative twist at Jin Hock Seafood with their Double Flavoured Hor Fun ($15). Your fingers dive first for deep-fried hor fun, and it feels like keropok. It's crispy with a slightly chewy middle. Savoury hor fun under it fills your mouth with wok hei, and the copious amount of thick gravy adds savoury flavour. You taste the maximum depth of flavour having both kinds in one mouthful. Tender pork slices, eleven clams, and chye sim are cooked with it. The pork is slightly chewy, with a pleasantly meaty taste, and the plump clams add some brininess.",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/5c391443e3afbfeb03c1572432_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Zi Char",,For Hor Fun Done Two Ways and More,"Up your hor fun game with the Double Flavoured Hor Fun ($15), which tops the regular noodle dish with deep-fried hor fun for a wonderful texture upgrade. According to Tastemaker Fiona Ting, the deep-fried rice noodles are ""delightfully crispy yet slightly chewy in the middle"", while the wok-hei laden regular hor fun beneath features generous amounts of lean pork, clams and greens. The chef's creativity extends to other zi char dishes here. Try the Fried Eggplant & French Beans ($12), an umami-rich dish of crisp yet soft battered eggplant, and Deep-Fried Garlic Pork ($12) — tender, juicy and, in Fiona's words, ""insanely addictive with the house made belacan"". This is just the spot to bring adventurous foodie friends for an inexpensive yet memorable meal.
Avg Price: $15 per person

Zi Char",,Sharing our dinner yesterday | Homemade Toufu with Fried Enoki Mushrooms ($18-Medium) .,"We went all the way to Tampines to eat this again after our last visit some months back. The homemade toufu was so soft and wobbly. Coupled with the fried stuffs on top (too little though 😂😂) and awesome minced meat gravy, this dish wasn't enough for 4A3C to share. Every drop of gravy was wiped out before other dishes.
.
The funny thing was, we happily ate until the end then sort of realized our favourite enoki was missing cos it didnt register to anybody that we already ate it (the fried stuffs). 😂
.
We are all used to the other very nice Braised Assorted Mushroom Homemade Toufu nearer to our house at Kranji Seafood. 😅

This recipe was inspired by the traditional Peranakan sayur lodeh. Creativity juices had pineapple chunks added for a dose of tang, cheddar and cream cheese for a taste of umami and a silky texture. Instead of ketupat, Korean rice cake was used to thicken up the broth for a more filling meal.
Personally, i found the taste of the soup a little underwhelming as there was no coconut aroma which was pretty much a must in any curry or Peranakan dish. Not too sure whether coconut cream was part of the recipe as there was no hint of it and yet, it was an ingredient mentioned.
As for the Korean rice cake, i wasn’t the biggest fan of it as having it semi melted in the soup and hence, no bite to it was a miss for me.
However, I enjoyed my flatbread of masala chicken with aioli very much and I guess that it was the only saving grace for the meal:(",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/80645d9a3eba0e1fa21664091_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Supper
Delivery",兴隆潮洲粥,Teochew Style Porridge,"""Cleaning"" my stomach with Comforting porridge meal.🤗
Porridge had a great consistency between gooey and watery.
- Pork Belly was tender, chewy and have melt in the mouth fats.😋
- Pork intestine was soft, succulent and cleaned thoroughly without the pungent taste.😍
- Fresh Blood Cockle was awesomely drenched in soya saucey and chilli padi to add some spice.🤩
- Brinjal was slimy, soft and covered in tasty dark soya.
- Duck apparently was quite normal, meat was not that soft enough.
- Stir fry hairy gourd with tang hoon and egg was great, crunchy and tasty.👌
- Hae Bee Hiam so-so, seems to lack spiciness and taste a bit weird.
- Meat with salted egg was kind of standard. Nothing special.
Total cost $33.80.

Fast Food",,Macdonalds Big Breakfast,"Each ingredient is not very good on its own but together it is a wonderful bite of burger, let me explain. Egg is smooth and moist, slight creaminess from the half cooked egg on the top, however it is bland from the lack of creamy flavour to it which would have been perfect. Meat patty is salty and peppery, a bit way too salty eaten by itself. Bun has a slight toughness and bite to it; eaten on its own will have people wondering if it is a poorly baked piece of old bread.
With the slight creaminess from the egg, saltiness from the patty and slight toughness to the bread, eaten together these ingredients compliments each other brilliantly. The salty patty brings up the savoury tastes of the egg and bun, while the soft texture of the egg balances out the tougher side of bun and patty. Overall, i like it, theres a reason why Big Breakfast has always been a hit with the locals. They demonstrated how distinctively separated ingredients which lacks on its own can come together and bring out the best of each other in one bite. Don’t get me wrong its not the best burger, but it satisfies and does quite a decent job to satisfy simple breakfast burger cravings.",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/5f8307018703587d6521634470_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Pros: Tasty dishes, good casual chinese restaurant ambience. Fresh ingredients. Fav dishes: Herbal roast duck, wheatgrass tofu, fermented bean kangkong, sea cucumber.
Cons: Pork dishes are not nice, too dry and tough. Most dishes are alright, nothing to shout about (but the few highlighted dishes are good). MSG laden. Understaffed, takes awhile to get their attention.

Halal",,Taro Salted Egg Chiffon Roll,"This cake is totally BOOOOOOMB OMG. The cake is sweet and really soft and fluffy, and the yam filling is really good! It has a nice sweet yam fragrance and I really like the texture. I was expecting the yam filling to be yam-flavoured cream, or something that tastes like those typical cake creams, but thankfully it isn't and actually tastes like yam. It's pretty comparable to BreadTalk's Yammy Mummy cake filling, except less chunky and much cheaper.
The salted egg custard is kind of overwhelmed by the yam though, I couldn't taste it at all when I had them together. When I tasted it alone, it definitely has a pretty strong savoury salted egg taste! Would be great if it was a bit more well balanced with the yam filling, but still delicious.
Go get yourself some if youre a taro / salted egg lover as this chiffon cake is 100% dino approved 👍
Ps just found out that they also sell this at neighbourhood Swee Heng outlets for $4.50, it's cheaper so get yours there if you can!

I personally prefer drinks, because I wouldn’t be able to finish the douhua if I ate the whole set myself😵 nonetheless, this is one of my favourite bkt branches to get a good, affordable, peppery bkt fix. The thing about old street is that they are often located in malls, making them a convenient location. However, one qualm may be that the size of the pork ribs really varies so if you’re unlucky you just might have really small pork ribs😂 or if you want to be safe you can opt for a different kind of ribs!

Served with a generous amount of rice noodles, slices of Australian beef and a couple of beef balls in a clear, translucent layer of oil beef broth. Do note that the rice noodles tend to clump together and it gets soggy pretty fast so don't soak and leave the noodles too long cos they tend to break apart easily. The Australian beef was very tender and soft, probably because it was sliced so thinly and beef balls were just okay. Anyway, this dish comes in a big bowl so those who are expecting the same small bowls of thai boat noodles we may be accustomed to in JB and KL, sorry to disappoint you though!
Price: $7.90
Mango Tango
To be honest, I've tasted better version of this. The glutinous sticky rice was dry and was a bit on the hard and chewy side, but the mango was decently sweet. So that sort of make up for it. But for the price I paid..... don't bother guys.

I just liked the small eggplants and the tenderness of the beef, however the taste seems ordinary; good enough. It also was too spicy for my liking (I can't take too spicy food). 😥 Anyway, it was filling and the ordering process is simple and convenient -- okayy, fun! I enjoyed inserting my payment to their machine. HAHA 😉

Halal",*Halal-certified,Thai Grilled Chicken Rice [$7.90] & Original Thai Milk Tea [$2.50] 🍗🍚🍹 This self-service seating restaurant has just opened today.,"Yesterday when I walked pass, they were still setting up the labels, tonight they are open for business. 🤗 What immediately took my attention as I walked inside were signages, ""self-service seating"" hanging on the ceiling and on the table was a note, ""thank you for returning your used dishes after meal"". Now I know what those signages meant. 😅
I decided to have grilled chicken rice for dinner partnered with milk tea. I wonder if I paired my tea correctly, according to Tea Pairing concept. Not an expert. Please forgive me, if didn't. 😜 Anyway, the Thai Grilled Chicken was tender. However, it lacked that 'Thai grilled' flavour that I was expecting. But not bad! It was delicious for a grilled chicken, in general. What carried the 'Thai' touch into the dish were the side dish and the Thai dipping sauce. Their service was commendable for being efficient, or was it just because not much people? 🤔 Overall, it was a worthwhile experience for a 1-day old restaurant. 😋 Surely, I'll visit again to try other dishes!

Halal",*Halal-certified,Grilled Chicken + Fried Chicken .,"You can never go wrong with the Thai Grilled Chicken Boat Noodle at @saapsaapthaisg The grilled chicken is done well. The soup base is slightly tangy and a little hint of spicy but not overwhelmingly so. 😘 I'm not a fan of the chicken meatballs but they add a different texture to the bowl
.
For sides, we had the wing and drumettes in saap saap sauce (which is sweet-spicy and hints of kecap cili api). Deep-fried and well-marinated, these wings and drumettes are a must for every meal here. But do note I was told these are only available at the OTH, WGS and Jewel outlets.

Ma Now (Our Tampines Hub Hawker Centre),1 REVIEW,0 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$5/pax,"Hawker Food
Thai",,Seabass En Papilotte,"Ma Now is yet another one of those F&B establishments which we had learnt about whilst scrolling around social media one day. The hawker centre at Our Tampines Hub is one of those hawker centres that have seen quite a number of tenants come and go over the years; there are also quite a number of pretty interesting stalls serving unconventional fare within the hawker centre. Therefore, it is really no surprise for us to know that Ma Now is one of the latest additions to the hawker centre at Our Tampines Hub — the establishment bearing a slogan of “Fun.Thai.Food” beneath its namesake on the signboard. There is already an existing tenant named Im Thai Kitchen that is serving up conventional Thai cuisine within the hawker centre of Our Tampines Hub; Ma Now attempts to serve up modern fusion Thai fare of its very own, creating a style of Thai cuisine that is unique to themselves. The menu at Ma Now does not feature a wide variety of communal dishes like how one would have expected at conventional Thai eateries. Instead, the menu of Ma Now features more of inventive individually-portioned dishes using various fusion elements to attract a younger audience — expect items such as the Basil Pork Donburi and the Thai Vermicelli; this would be aside from the small list of equally creative sides which they have to offer like the Tuna Salad Pie Tee that can be shared around the table.
Skimming through the menu of Ma Now even before making our way down to the stall, we were already pretty much fixated on going for the Seabass En Papilotte — an item which we thought was pretty rare to find in a hawker centre setting. For those whom are unfamiliar with the dish, the dish essentially features seabass that is steamed in a sealed parchment paper bag to allow it to cook in its own juices. Whilst the cooking method originates from Europe, Ma Now’s rendition of the dish sees a Thai twist — the dish features Thai lime and chilli to achieve that flavour that one would associate with Thai cuisine instead. The Seabass En Papilotte also comes with a complimentary bowl of rice on the side as well; an item which is designed for the individual diner in mind. It is noted that the item does require more preparation time than the other items listed on the menu here — so do be aware of the waiting time involved with the serving of the dish. Digging into the Seabass En Papilotte, it is evident which particular classic Thai dish that the Seabass En Papilotte is based on; this modern interpretation of the Steamed Fish with Lime and Garlic would do especially for those who do not wish to deal with the bones of the fish. Served as a de-boned fillet, the seabass does come with the skin on; all that whilst also coming with the lime and chili broth sitting beneath the slab of fish — there are also garlic and lime slices placed atop the fish as well. Admittedly, we did find the Seabass cooked for a little too long; not much of an issue here, though our preference would have been for the flesh to come a little softer and flakier since it was a little bit on the firmer side — not too bothersome for us though. The Thai Lime and Chili broth itself helps to add a distinct zippy note that was especially refreshing — went well with the steamed seabass, though we did detect a bitter aftertaste which intensifies as we go further with the dish which was not quite to our fancy; still went well with just a bit of fish and a bit of rice for each mouthful nonetheless.
Ma Now is an establishment that pretty much has its own ideas and interpretation of what a modern and fun take of Thai food should be — the Thai fare that it intends to serve definitely satisfies the slogan that they have created for their brand, though we do feel that they are still trying to figure out how to exactly make these interpretations of Thai food work. Items like the Basil Pork Donburi do sound like items that are quite comforting; a fusion of very familiar items between Thai and Japanese culture — that being said, we did feel that the dish was a little lacking when in terms of texture and that could also be the said about the flavour as well. While the savoury minced pork was tasty, there was a lack of a spicy kick that helps to further provide for the extra oomph; the entire dish, including the basil, seemed a little bit too dry as well — the basil therefore also seemed to lack flavour as a result. Given how it is modelled after a Japanese Donburi, we also felt that the dish could have done with more moisture; perhaps a dash of fish sauce or the sauce used in the preparation of the basil pork would help with things a little. Despite having some room for improvement, one could tell the effort that the folks behind Ma Now placed behind each of their creation — this did not go unnoticed with their Creamy Tom Yum Soup, which comes all tangy without being overly creamy and thus was actually easy for us to finish the entire bowl of soup; the Creamy Tom Yum Soup also coming with a skewer of shrimp, cherry tomato and mushroom for a heightened aesthetic appeal. Prices of the food at Ma Now is priced slightly higher than that of usual hawker food — prices of all the dishes served here are above $5, though none of the dishes exceeds the $10 price point; we do think that it is somewhat justified considering how there is a constant emphasis on keeping their Thai fare fun and modern, though we do wish they could look into the aspects mentioned here to further refine on their offerings. Ma Now does have a fresh take of Thai cuisine much like how HUE restaurant at Jalan Besar does; a spot that is worth considering dining at if within the Tampines area.",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/1685920929_review_image1969921_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

.
Presentation is iconic, using large, old-school metal plates, with the chili in metal bowls that resemble the chwee kueh moulds.
.
The juicy pork and liver 5 spice rolls have nice meaty savoury salty spice earthy notes, the soft water chestnut cakes have lovely earthy sweet savoury flavour, and the fish cake is bouncy and large with sweet savoury notes.
.
The prawn cracker fritter shatters lightly with savoury shrimpy sweet flavour, while the chewy guan chang / Chinese marinated sausage is meaty with savoury salty flavour.
.
I like that they're generous with the crushed peanuts, and the inclusion of cucumbers is good. The chili is lightly spicy salty, with a mild kick. Nice.

This is totally a hidden food gem in the east and I would say that it taste way better than any of the nasi lemak I have tried. The ingredients were freshly prepared and fried. They are all crispy and not super oily kind of deep fried food.
Interestingly they prepared the bee hoon using the rice cook to stir fried it (probably to prevent fire accident) but the white bee hoon taste really good and you really have to depend on luck to see whether you get to try the white bee hoon because it run out pretty fast.
Another point to note is that they open till around like 10am in the morning, you really have to be an early bird to be able to try this and as they are located within the wet market so you only get to dabao it. 📍 Tampines Street 21, 201 Wet Market (located beside the egg stall)",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/2f29a79004af7b87b5b61667462_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

The fish was really fresh and it is definitely worth it to pay the price for the fish head.
We particularly also liked their Japanese style pork ribs ($13). The pork ribs were nicely marinated with their japanese style sauce and the floss which was sprinkle on top of the pork ribs blend really well.

Located in the Coffeeshop side by side with a rather popular bah Chor noodle stall.
The stall serve the similar snack selection like most Ngo Hiang stall has. What set it apart was the freshness of the ingredients ; it’s chilli sauce and it’s presentation of food that totally blow my mind. Let’s dive into the detail.
Ngo Hiang - they have typical cured cuttlefish; fried prawn cracker; chestnut cake ; bean curb ; cured sausages and etc which spell freshness . It also serve the rare pig liver Ngo Hiang that was hard to find nowadays. Owner has also the skill to fry the ingredients and yet not oily which the plate has not much oil left.
Chilli sauce - typical chilli sauce are hot which also serve along with sweet sauce. Not for this stall which they only serve one kind of chilli sauce. The sauce spiciness is acceptable and is of savoury with hint of garlic and serve with fresh ground peanuts.
Presentation - Probably one of the most innovative usage to serve to food which owner uses metallic plates for putting in Ngo Hiang ; bee hoon and chilli sauce. The chilli sauce saucer plate was like a rice cake saucer plate made of aluminium which I think is really good idea and nostalgic.
Total 11 ingredients in this picture plus 2 plates of bee hoon cost me $15 which is reasonable in comparison with other Ngo Hiang Stall.",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/48d2a71a3c6991e4cf61631507_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

This gives each plate a unique layering of taste, yet it doesn't distract from the soft moist taste of the carrot cakd itself.
.
The white version is my preference here, smoky savoury spicy eggy sweet in flavour, the notes of curry and egg amd shrimp quite distinct.
.
The black version is also well loved, smoky sweet spicy eggy savoury in flavour. Here, the curry is tamed with the dark sweet soy sauce, though you still get the taste of the egg and shrimp. I find the contrast a tad jarring.

The fried chicken was awesome and the batter was very crispy. It was not overcooked whatsoever.

Ordered Set B (Chicken Wing) and Set C (Yellow Fish) at S$4 each. Value for money for the portion size! Each set comes with crispy ikan bilis & peanuts, fried egg, chilli and cucumber.
What's special is that they use premium #basmatirice cooked with coconut milk. I like the texture of this rice as it's light and fluffy, unlike the normal coconut rice used in nasi lemak.
❤ Love the turmeric chicken wing fried till crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The spicy-sweet sambal chilli is good too.

Nasi Lemak
Halal",*Muslim-owned,"I am rather reluctant to share about this nasi lemak place because I am worried that the next time I am there, I might not be able to get a plate because this is truly a hidden gem that is waiting to shine in the bright spotlight.","The several times that I am there at about 12:30pm on a weekday, all the food has been sold out but fortunately, this time round, I was there much earlier and managed to get one of the last few plates of this elusive nasi lemak. As the stall name suggests, the only thing that you must get is their nasi lemak as they are truly specialists in this dish. Using premium grade basmati rice and fresh coconut milk, the rice is wonderfully fragranced that you just cannot get enough of, and tag teaming the rice is the slightly sweet, mildly spicy sambal.
For true nasi lemak connoisseurs, the two most important elements are the rice and sambal and the Nasi Lemak Specialist nailed both flawlessly. Going back to basics, the original nasi lemak does not have many accompanying ingredients and what these originators focus on are solely the rice and sambal and as time goes by, more ingredients get added into it but the most familiar and straightforward ones are the fried egg, crispy anchovies and peanuts, and the chicken wing. The egg here is nothing out of this world, just a regular fried egg, but the crispy anchovies and peanuts are so well deep fried that it provides the right crunch and flavour. Last but not least, the chicken wing and I will end my review with a few words of it; one chicken is not enough, trust me and get at least two.
Never underestimate the art of perfecting simplicity because that’s the true definition of a good plate of food.

137 Lor Mee Prawn Mee (Tampines Round Market),5 REVIEWS,2 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$5/pax,Hawker Food,,Crispy Fish Chunks That Stay Crisp Even In Sauce!,"[ Food Week — Hawker Food ] As we approach the tail end of this season’s food week, it’s time to bring out some of my favourite local dishes that I rarely get the chance to feature, be it due to distance or calories (heh).
Believe it or not, there was a pretty extended period in my life when I subsisted on lor mee nearly every other day! Even though I don’t showcase it much, I adore the dish. Cue today’s feature: 137 Lor Mee Prawn Noodles at Tampines Round Market!
137LM is no exception. Opening at ripe hour of 6.30am, if you’re lucky, visiting at 10am m a y net you the last bowl before the stall starts wiping down for the day. Be warned! (All this being pre-P2 ofc; for now, please don’t forget to support your favourite stalls by taking away food looking at places like WhyQ to see if they offer delivery!)
I know many of us lor mee meisters have v e r y strong opinions on what constitutes a worthy bowl of lor mee. As someone whose opinion tend to skate along the edges of near blasphemy, let me get one thing straight: Lighter lor mee broth doesn’t mean less flavour!!! /deep exhale/
Growing up on lor mee with thinner/lighter sauces — specifically Clementi’s Ah Ma Lor Mee — I’ve never once felt the lack of a viscous, sticky broth detracted from the dish. As long as the chef knows how to balance their ingredients, they can still create a beautiful bowl no less worthy than its denser counterparts. After all, coherence and character are what build the unique signature of each stall.
137LM can be polarising for some: Those who enjoy heavy, substantial “lor” won’t get it here. The broth is lighter and easier to enjoy with your noodles; in spite of that, the aromatics and spices are unmistakeable, and when paired with the near ridiculous amount of toppings — fried fish chunks, ngoh hiang, fish cake, pork belly, egg — makes the entire experience a coherent yet vivid one. (Try imagining digging through stiff, sticky sauce trying to retrieve all those goodies, ugh — this is why the broth here is lighter.)
Oh, did I mention they have amazing crispy fish nuggets? Despite being drenched, these crispy pieces never wilt! And you get a ton of them regardless of serving size!",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/335408506e016a14dc061900741_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

With 2 sets of 1-1 Mixed Grill and 1 ala carte Aglio Olio, the total cost is only $39.50. Which works out to be $7.90 only. The serving is extremely generous and good that mixed gril can choose between black pepper or mushroom sauce. My friends commented that the greens maybe too little. But overall still the best value for money. Wish that different locations can have different selection so that we get to try different types of Western Food.",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/30f4779ef4bdbcf15a401912552_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

In fact, for the past two months, I have been ordering takeaways from Foodpanda and Deliveroo. There is one outlet that delivers consistently excellent (value-for-money) food and that’s Collin’s Grille.
This ‘Grilled Salmon Fillet with Pesto Cream, Pasta, Corn and Salad’ costs only $11.90. Look at the ginormous salmon fillet! Best of all, it tastes consistently good.
The salmon is perfectly cooked with crispy edges, the pasta al dente, the corn (OMG) superbly sweet!!! Don’t like corn? Try theirs! Their corn is life-changing!
If they are this good for delivered food, you can imagine the high standards of the food they serve at their outlet!
You can’t get anything of better value on Foodpanda and Deliveroo. Damn ‘tokong’! Highly recommend!",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/2f124612b9e7cafd57301678647_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

As usual, indecisive me overordered (kinda, but we finished them all). At $10.20 for a bento of grilled salmon with sweet-tangy mango sauce, pasta and sides, this was pretty decent and value-for-money. Really enjoyed the 1/4 roasted chicken with sweet BBQ sauce on the smokey, tender pork ribs ($18). Also got the buffalo drumlets ($5.90) which were tangy with a little heat. Portion was a bit tiny but finger-lickin' good as a perfect TV snack! The most impressive dish was definitely the curry chicken baked rice ($10.20), even with delivery it came piping hot and so cheesy, with generous chunks of chicken. Tasted more like Japanese curry which we didn't mind, pretty comforting! For the whole of next week (1st -7th August), Deliveroo is having a 1-for-1 promotion from selected merchants because you deserve the best. Just key in your location search for western food nearby, and order them. Easy peasy, though you might have a hard time making decisions with so many choices available!

Delivery",,Mango Yogurt | $6.60,"Alas, after three tries, I think I found my favorite combination! Declaring my favourite as Mango yogurt might be a cliche, but it did win my heart unlike the purple rice & oats yogurt. The mango compote contained mango flesh, and with real fruit, it just made the yogurt instantly taste better😅 However, as I wasn’t too well-versed with the sweetness levels at Yomie’s, and the staff only asked if I wanted ‘normal or less sugar’, I opted for less - when there was actually an option for No sugar. I would definitely have preferred that, as I felt that even with less sugar, this drink was a tad bit sweet.

Delivery",,Oats Yogurt | $5.60,"Just like how I felt about their Purple Rice Yogurt, this Oats Yogurt got me feeling slightly ambivalent. What started out as crunchy oats became soggier at the end inevitably, and it lacked the chew the purple rice would give. In a thick textured yogurt drink like this, oats seemingly did not blend so well unlike making your own one (with store-bought yogurt). Nonetheless, I did think it was pretty decent! And definitely worth a try if you fancy oats in your food & drink👍🏻

Delivery",,Purple Rice Yogurt | $5.60,"Finally got down to trying this yogurt drink that can be deemed the healthier alternative to bubble teas out there. The on point drink aesthetics aside, this yogurt drink was pleasantly surprising. Truth be told, I had no idea what to expect as I have never tried anything like this before. On first taste, it was a bit weird to feel something savoury in a yogurt drink. I personally did not enjoy the taste of rice in my drink - but I know some people do. What I appreciated though, was the chewiness which came with the purple rice. Plus points to the thick texture of the yogurt (and great flavour generally as well), which helped to overwhelm the rice flavour and bring out the chewiness of the rice with balance. Would recommend trying this if you haven’t, at least for the experience! But for me, I’ll definitely be trying their other flavours (:

Handmade potato noodle tossed in dark sauce, topped with fries pork balls, boiled pork balls, egg and vegetables.

The potato noodle is light and soft, but not mushy. The mild sauce coated the noodle, similar taste to pontian wanton mee. While the fried pork balls packs the delicious oink oink. Don't expect burst of flavour but look at it as solid chow.

Western",,Western Fried Rice with Chicken Chop ($8.50) plus egg ($9.20)🍚🍗🍳,"Craving for some comforting Western fare, I ordered the Western Fried Rice with Chicken Chop from Peri Peri Grill & Pasta. The plate of piping hot fried rice was loaded with ham and egg, and had a strong garlicky taste that gave it a deliciously bold flavour. However, the rice was a tad mushy, which was a slight letdown.
The Chicken Chop, on the other hand, was a highlight of the dish. It was savoury and tender, with a hint of charred smokiness that added a delightful crispness to the exterior. The black pepper sauce drizzled over the chicken added an extra kick of flavour, and the mixed herbs sprinkled on top provided a burst of freshness.

Hup Heng Bedok 510 Prawn Noodle (445 Tampines),1 REVIEW,0 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$5/pax,Hawker Food,,Soup is Bland.. Was this an off day?,"Haven't had much luck with prawn noodles lately..... Read good reviews about Hup Heng Bedok 510 Prawn Noodle & it's also highly rated (4.8/5 stars) on Google Maps..... Was in the area so I decided to swing by over lunch to check it out.
Service was friendly & with a smile, but I was disappointed by how bland this soup tasted. There was no umaminess, nor was there a solid taste of seafood in the broth... It was just like, Idk, chicken stock? & to me, the broth has a huge part to play in a comforting bowl of prawn mee.
Ingredients-wise, they're not bad actually. The clams were plentiful & the prawns sizeable & fairly fresh. Topped with fragrant fried shallots, too. But the soup really lost me.
Did I come on a wrong day? Perhaps. I would hope so. Not that keen to return, too.... Unless it was super convenient again & I had no other options to consider.

Zi Char",,"RUN, don’t walk to this Tze Char!","One of the most iconic food centres in the East has to be Tampines Round Market and, as one of its oldest occupants, I'm sure @shenlirestaurant is no stranger to many of the Tampines residents!😄
Ngl the name Shen Li did not ring a bell at first, until I mentioned its name to my dad who was coming along for the meal, and he exclaimed that this was the stall at which we had many birthday meals at with our extended family. Recently passed to the 3rd generation, this stall does indeed trigger a huge wave of nostalgia.😌
Here’s what we enjoyed…🤤
👉Claypot Tauhuey - SGD10
👉Blueberry Chicken - SGD12/18
👉Chilli Milk Prawns - SGD16/24
👉Coffee Pork - SGD15
👉Sambal Stingray - SGD15/18
👉Stir-fry Nai Bai
With the passing over to the new gen, Shen Li adds another unique appeal to its nostalgic charm. By retaining classics such as the Coffee Pork and introducing new dishes such as the Blueberry Chicken & Claypot Tauhuey, we were treated to a refreshed menu that retained its roots in taste.😬
Personal favourites has to be the Chilli Milk Prawns and Sambal Stingray. Both dishes were testimony to the fresh ingredients used at Shen Li, and both were also really well-marinated.😋
For the adventurous, do try their Blueberry Chicken that came with a slightly tart blueberry mayo on top of the fried chicken cutlet. The Claypot Tauhuey was also what we think is a great twist to the usual hotplate beancurd.😉
All in all, @shenlirestaurant is definitely a Tze Char stall worth visiting and I can guarantee that you'll be a recurring customer once you've tried them!☺️

Newly Opened",,"After close to 50 years in Bukit Merah, KEK Seafood has finally opened its new outlet in the East, bringing their signature zichar dishes to the East-siders.","Located in a 120-seater, air-conditioned space in SAFRA Tampines, the menu here features their signature dishes and a lineup of new items. Besides their popular mainstays such as Signature Moonlight Horfun ($7.80), Coffee Pork Ribs ($15.80) and Golden Pearl Roll ($14.80), there will be 5 exclusive dishes for this outlet.
The Claypot Premium Collagen Soup ($24.80/$48.80) is one of the new favourites, a soul-comforting peppery soup with generous slices of pig’s stomach, fish maw and dried beancurd. Perfect for rainy days or chilly weathers, this will warm your heart and belly instantly. The other new addition is the Claypot KEK-style Vermicelli Crab ($88/kg, seasonal) which comes with a whole mud crab that is flash fry and fragranced with scallions, fried garlic and house-made seafood sauce. This dish will be served tableside with hot garlic oil drizzled over, adding to the overall fragrance.
The other exclusive dishes include the Homemade Tofu Loofah with Sliced Fish ($18.80/$28.80), Claypot Pig Liver with Rice ($18.80/$25.80) which has pig liver slices cooked together with ginger and onion in a sauce before adding a bowl of rice into it, and Claypot Braised Duck with Yam ($29.80/$49.80), a family recipe passed down for three generations and contains braised duck, sea cucumber, mushrooms and celery cooked in an umami-rich sauce.

Western",,Signature Spicy Battered Dory | $8.80,"Love the batter here because there’s an option for spicy and original - and the spicy batter always gives a good kick and refreshing flavour than other fish & chips out there. In fact, the batter is relatively thin, so you don’t feel too overwhelmed by it. Some might find the dory fillet itself salty and maybe a bit tad slimy - but I’d look past it for the price & the fact that it’s a dory (really, not an atas fish you’d have high expectations for). The mashed potatoes and corn are nothing special, but an alternative if you don’t want chips/fries. Like almost all fish & chips, this meal felt extremely oily and heavy at the end. But for the price, it is an affordable option for a good meal of fish & chips.

Mushroom soup was the standard kind of taste you get, nothing amazing.
Chips were not as crisp as it should be
Great fish though, the batter was crisp and meat was chunky, tender, and not too flaky that it will fall apart. Sad that it is only one piece of it in the entire meal. Definitely not enough for big eater
Advice: Dont miss out on the sauces. Some sauces can be easily charged at $1 for one small tub of it (salted egg yolk and wasabi mayo). Probably that's why they go super light with the flavoring of the chips.

Western",,Fish & Crisps • Crispy White Bait,"• Dory Fish & Crisps (S$7.80+)
This comes with a piece of fried Dory fish served with crispy razor thin potato chips. Despite their range of fishes to choose from, I personally preferred their Dory fish which was the cheapest but also the nicest because there isn’t any fishy or “mud” smell and it was soft.
• Tilapia Fish & Crisps (S$8.70+)
This comes with a piece of fried Tilapia fish (slightly bigger size than Dory) served with crispy razor thin potato chips. There’s a slight “mud” smell for Tilapia fish, so try dipping it in the dips (sauces) provided to cover the “mud” smell.
• Crispy White Bait (S$6.60+)
It was a pretty decent fried white baits, not much marination I supposed.
• Boost - Drink + Soup (S$4+)
It was mushroom soup, but the consistency was thin, and taste was very diluted. I guess they used those powder form of mushroom instead of cooking it themselves. Wouldn’t order their soup again.
Free-flow dips: Cheese, Curry Mayo, Salted Egg and Tartar Sauce. My favourite will be the curry mayo! The curry mayo sauce is flavorful with slight curry powder taste.

First visit to @threesacrowdcafe, the one that caught my attention is the Churros Waffles ($12.50, I added on a scoop of ice cream as well).
The churros waffles came with a layer of cinnamon sugar but the waffles is alittle too soft. I was expecting it to be more crispy like a churros. The original set comes with 4 quarter pieces, chocolate syrup and marshmallows (the marshmallows are a little out of place here tho).

#JonApproves
7/10
Nutella waffle with Baked Apple & Roasted Pistachio($18.50) - Legit ice cream. More gelato kind. Smooth. Ice cream flavors are on the light side, the flavor ain't obviously distinct unless taking big scoops of them. Baked Apple had apple bits inside. But still, the texture isn't like the cheap kind. Ice cream scoop is big also. But they go well with th waffle with cereal. Nutella waffle with cereal is good combo as the firmness of waffle is replaced with crunchiness of cereal. Waffle is a tad too airy tho.. For a good dessert,this is not bad. Sweet overall.",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/2eeb9c7271e1fa8a41b81905369_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Got a waffle to go with two scoops of ice cream, namely the Leegacy, which is the café’s signature flavor of dark chocolate and the refreshing Grapefruit & Berry which has a nice tartness and tanginess to it.

*Halal-certified",Fried Chicken & Waffles ($12),"This was really bad :( 2 of us shared it and we couldn’t finish it at all because it was really hard to eat. The fries and chicken were basically frozen and air-fried or something similar as there was little colour to them and they tasted really flat and unflavourful. The quantity of fries (and having it just thrown on top like that) was also quite little. The waffles were okay but quite soft so it made the dish feel quite haphazardly thrown together (like a bad frozen dinner). It’s rather expensive too for this quality. Perhaps we came at a busy time but it truly doesn’t seem like if they had more time, it would be better. Would definitely not recommend at all - please do not waste your money!",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/2d941c6d074016dc8fc1885643_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

*Halal-certified",Good Ice Cream And Waffles,"Regular waffles ($6) with a scoop of ""Leegacy"" (dark chocolate) ice cream ($4 for premium flavour). Waffles were delicately crisp on the outside and fluffy and tender inside. The ice cream was unusual in that it had an intense dark chocolate flavour, but was otherwise very light and almost delicate. A good choice to eat on its own as it is unlikely to become ""jelat"", but not the best pairing for the waffles owing to its absence of a rich mouthfeel and the lack of sweetness of both elements of the dish.

The chocolate flavour is a must get, as it is not so sweet, but yet so rich on their chocolate flavours. Kris Grey flavour is a neutralizing flavour if you are getting many rich flavours, as it is not sweet and the early grey tea notes is really refreshing.

*Halal-certified",Ice Cream 🍨 With Waffles,"I realised this cafe just open after my graduation back two years ago. I decided to explore back and I like the atmosphere of the cafe and also ordering Caramel Biscotti (Classic - $3.50) and Drunken Raisins (Premium - $4.50) with add-on the waffles ($6.00). For Drunken Raisins, I realised that they also mixed with bailey and raisins and also quite strong taste on the raisins itself. Got 2nd waffles order have 50% offer. It’s quite affordable cafe that you can order a variety of cakes, ice cream, waffles and also drinks from them. I also noticed about their set meal for tea break ($22) serves drinks, ice cream and waffles. It located directly at tampines west mrt station and also convenient for people who want to try it. Sadly, they don’t have kris grey ice cream anymore and choose another flavour to replace it.

The espresso is not exactly what I expected it to be as it is quite sweet and taste just like coffee ice cream.

*Halal-certified",Great Ice Cream Hidden In The Neighbourhood,"Had double scoop ice cream ($6.50 for non-premium 1 for 1 #burpplebeyond) and ordered the cookies and cream, vanilla, salted caramel and dark chocolate ice cream. Firstly I got to say the scoops were HUMONGOUS and would definitely require more than 2 to share.
The cookies and cream and vanilla were decent, as its difficult to go wrong with it. The salted caramel was interesting and was a good blend with the other ice cream flavours as its saltiness can offset the sweetness from the other flavours.
The dark chocolate ice cream on the other hand, was LEGENDARY. Its definitely a must get, as the amount of cocoa in it is amazing. Dab your spoon in the ice cream and you know how thick it is. With a strong cocoa flavour, and it's smooth melty texture, it's a real orgasmic moment in your mouth.",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/2fd68bfe3a7ed2afafa01712378_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

*Halal-certified","With some recent changes, Three’s put together the best of a waffle and a churro.","The result was a waffle that was not only light and fluffy with a crispy crust, but also carried the tasty cinnamon fragrance of churros.
To top it up, it was served with melted marshmallows in hot dark chocolate dip which complemented well between the dark chocolate and gooey sweet marshmallow.
Paired with a dark chocolate gelato, the dessert brought smiles to our faces with textures and flavour we haven’t had elsewhere.
However, we hope this wouldn’t be all that we’ll smile over at this cafe. Sampled a number of their other gelato flavours and many were a tad too sweet to our liking (which landed us with the dark chocolate that was perfect for the waffle). The paintings in the cafe embodied a dark and heavy mood, exhibited in their counter staff too. A rather unusual theme for a place for some sweets with happy thoughts. Nonetheless, the churro waffle we had was one memorable tasty treat to check out.",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/5e97b6573ce7618c8841689794_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

*Halal-certified",Chic 'n' Waffles!,"Wanted something savory and went ahead with one of the 2 choices (the other being chicken nuggets) they offered. Asked for the dish to be deconstructed to avoid the risk of being served waffles drenched in maple syrup.. glad I did!
The waffles were solid lah - crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. Just the way most people will like it, I guess (I generally prefer mine underdone).
The chicken pieces (four of 'em) were
-heads up, the health-conscious ones-
air-fried, but it was a 2:1 ratio of batter to meat.
Nonetheless, the staff (just one young lady, actually) was pleasant and was able to handle a full house all by herself! Kudos to her for that.

*Halal-certified",Cookies & Cream Lava Cake ($6.90),"A humble space with minimalist, Scandinavian-themed decors, a high ceiling, and a very calming vibe, which is strongest on a quiet weekday afternoon.
I had their Cookies & Cream Lava Cake with a scoop of Thai Milk Tea gelato here. To some disappointment, it was devoid of any lava flow, which is quintessential of any lava cake. 😕 The gelato was way too sweet for me too, which served to hamper my enjoyment. And the ring of chocolate ganache and raspberry sauce tasted no less than a store-bought quality. 😩
But credit where it's due, the lava cake was pretty tasty. And I think another flavour that's closer to vanilla would've suited it better. I'll come back and give another go sometime! 😋 (6.6/10)",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/4cd438983bce87a4c8c1560259_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

*Halal-certified",Rose Buttercream Cake,"Rounded up at Three's A Crowd for dessert again and decided to try the cake here instead this time round. Being displayed in the display chiller at the counter, the buttercream comes slightly hardened so those whom prefer their buttercream smooth should wait a little for the buttercream to soften a little before consumption. Overall, the combination is actually quite decent; the Rose Buttercream provides for a flavour similar to Bandung with a light hint of buttery cream that comes at the end — both flavours being subtle yet evident. The sponge comes decently moist and fluffy, making this cake a pretty good one especially with it's pretty affordable price at $5.50 for a single slice.",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/2e78d7c3d19f8a74e11e1548230_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

*Halal-certified",Two Scoops' A Company,"No time to nurse our food coma after our heavy meal of tzechar at Tampines Round Market and even from the several rounds of eating before that; as dessert is a must (says me). And of course there's no time like the present so we went down to a place that I have been meaning to visit, Three's A Crowd nestled in the heartland of Tampines. The perfect sweet ending with cakes, waffles and ice cream on the offerings, my eyes and tummy was naturally drawn to the simple pairing of waffles and ice cream.
Having a double scoop ($3 each) of their classic flavours - refreshing Strawberry and aromatic Espresso, their house-made selections overall were a hit and miss for me as some didn’t embody the taste of its namesake. However, I was really pleased with our choice. Also the waffles ($6) were a winner. Ohh fluffy and slightly airy, the batter was pretty legit. I also love my waffles with crispy edges to mop up all the ice cream and the yummy stack was exactly that.",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/1c299c4a61a76d870141546379_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

*Halal-certified",Strawberry Ice-Cream,"After quite a few rounds of eating, we found ourselves winding up at Three's A Crowd for dessert. Was feeling a tad adventurous so I decided to go straight for the Strawberry ice-cream without trying the flavours. Sure enough, this was exactly what I expected and was craving for — the Strawberry ice-cream here isn't your typical artificially flavoured fare; the richness of the flavours of caramalised (?) strawberries without being overly sweet was actually pretty uplifting after a heavy meal of tzechar. I heard that they also do bake their own cakes apart from serving ice-cream that is churned by themselves; a pretty hidden find at Tampines!",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/38aafc2a11166fbc25a1544566_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

*Halal-certified",For a Humble Dessert Shop in Tampines,"Nestled in a sleepy part of Tampines, Three's a Crowd Cafe dishes out cakes, waffles and ice cream — perfect for a sweet treat with your friends. Share the fluffy waffles that come with crispy edges and top it off with one of their house-made ice creams. There are 14 flavours to choose from, so you'll be spoilt for choice! Tea lovers, go for the Kris Grey ($3.50) — a smooth earl grey ice cream with a strong punch, a result of them steeping Ette brand tea leaves in milk for 12 hours. Alcoholics will love the Baileys ($4.50) and the Drunken Raisins ($4.50). The latter comes with raisins soaked in rum for more than a month — we only wished there were more! Not in the mood for ice cream? Three's a Crowd Cafe also serves cake by the slice, all baked in-house of course, like the crowd-pleasing Strawberry Shortcake ($5.80 per slice).

*Halal-certified","Classic Waffle With Ice Cream ($6, $3/$4 Per Scoop)","New little joint just opened, nestled in a quiet part of Tampines and they're serving up some legit ice cream made in-house.
Got the waffles with their Drunken Raisins and Kris Grey (their own earl grey recipe, steeping Ette brand tea leaves in milk for long, goooood soak). The Drunken Raisins packed a punch! While the ice cream itself was relatively mild, the raisins were devilishly potent – a result of soaking them in alcohol for over a month (though I wished there were more)! Kris Grey was very well balanced with really nice aromatics that you'd expect from earl grey ice cream. But what I loved was how smooth all the ice creams were. They might not have the craziest concoctions, but the ice creams are sure to satisfy any dessert cravings.
Oh yea, their waffles were good too. Crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside. 😂",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/4f395be89a1f921ed3a1528986_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Jae was drawn to their Baileycoco Cake when she first saw it on their Instagram but sadly, they didn't have it when we visited yesterday.
(Kae: Imagine Jae being upset)
•
Regardless, we settled for their Lemon Basil cake with Strawberry Ice-Cream as recommended by their staff! The cake was light and moist with slight sourness and faint mint flavor. It was a rather interesting combination and together with the Strawberry Ice-Cream, it gave off a refreshing taste.
•
Though they do not have an extensive choice of Ice-Cream and cakes, they have waffles and drinks on their menu too. We are guessing that it's a one man show as the boss was saying that he didn't have time to bake the Baileycoco Cake. Also, since there isn't a large crowd yet, we could stay awhile longer just to chill and chat too.

*Halal-certified",Horlicks Waffle ($12),"Golden brown waffles dusted with generous amount of Horlicks powder, cornflakes, almonds, drizzled with salted horlicks sauce and served with Salted Horlicks ice-cream
.
As I cut into the golden brown waffle, I could a nice crackle sound. The golden brown waffles are fluffy on the side and crispy on the outside
.
The cornflakes and almonds added a nice crunch to the golden brown waffle while the caramel sauce provider a touch of sweetness
.
However as for the maltiness flavour-wise, most of it came from the generous dusting of Horlicks powder. The maltiness from the salted horlicks ice-cream tasted rather faint and also the texture was a tad too icy for my liking though
.
Perhaps it would taste better if the Salted Horlicks ice-cream had a more creamier consistency

*Halal-certified",Churro Waffle With Espresso Ice-Cream,"🇸🇬 We had Churro Waffle with Espresso Ice-Cream which came with a cup of Chocolate Fondue and Caramelized Marshmellows!
•
Our one big regret was not pouring the Chocolate over the Waffle as we dipped our Waffle and Ice-Cream instead. The Chocolate solidfies when we dipped the Ice-Cream and tasted divine! Their Espresso Ice-Cream is really on-point too, slight bitterness and not overly sweet! The Churro Waffle was coated with Cinnamon (that we both ain't a fan of) was crispier than usual!
•
From our previous visit, they have changed the layout of their shop slightly and introduced more varieties into their menus! We also saw the Baileycoco Cake Jae wanted to have previously but we were too full to have it so, till the next time!

For spicy lovers, you can request for some cut chilis to add to the pasta to increase the spiciness or you can just slurp up the linguine which is able to hold onto the creamy laksa sauce well. The pasta comes with an assortment of seafood such as mussel, prawn and squid. The other main that we had comes with a piece of tender grilled chicken thigh, served with truffle potato mash, side salad and a homemade brown sauce. To end your meal, get the Honey Yuzu Cake ($6.90) which the kitchen baked by themselves and you will be surprised with the yuzu bits inside the sponge cake. Last but not least, wash it down with some coffee that is brewed using beans from Tiong Hoe Speciality Coffee.

The 7th Heaven KTV & Cafe is a cafe during the daytime and restaurant music bar at night. They have live band performance on Friday nights from 7.30pm to 10pm for us to enjoy TGIF. Moreover, they have 15 private karaoke rooms available for us to book and sing 🎤(refer to their website for details). During our recent visit, we were there to chill and makan and have ordered the following mains/ sides:
1️⃣ Pulled Pork Burger ($17.90)
2️⃣ Laksa Pasta ($17.90)
3️⃣ Garlicky Honey Paprika Wings ($11.90)
Personally, one of my favourite would be the pulled pork burger. Tbh, I am definitely not a fan of burgers, but I find that the bun used for the burger at 7th Heaven Cafe is soft for my liking. Also, the pulled pork which is slow cooked tender smoked pork, has a tender and moist texture, which almost melts in our mouth 😊. The wings were crispy and well marinated. 📍 7th Heaven KTV & Cafe

It's made of cheddar, mozzarella and parmesan, lychee and smoked duck. The 3 cheese really stood out in this pizza and the cheesy taste kept pulling me back for another slice. I liked it that they paired the smoked duck with lychee. It added balance and sweetness to this strongly flavoured dish. Eating this pizza surprised me in so many ways.. from the onset of even enjoying the pizza to the end where I praised a dish with fruits in it (I don't like fruits in my food).

I can't believe a KTV cafe can produce pasta one can crave for. The tangy homemade laksa sauce leaves a lingering aftertaste that makes you keep thinking of the dish. The Pasta uses linguine one of my favourite choice for this dish and it really beats a lot of cafe establishments hands down.

If you are thinking that the food served here will be mediocre, you will be in for a pleasant surprise.
The succulent ribs are humongous and extremely juicy and not to forget to mention the thick and savoury BBQ sauce coating it. The chewy pulled pork and pipping hot paprika fries are very appetising as well but the salted egg wings are the real gem.
The salted egg yolk sauce is incredibly flavoursome and the wings themselves are fried to a delightful crisp.

Local Delights",,Large Beef Noodles,"Have wanted to try this for a long time and indeed, it really lives up to it's hype. The dish comes with 粗米粉 drenched in a thick broth made with beef stock and other beef parts, and has a tinge of Chinese herbs to it as well, which sets this broth apart from that at many other stalls. However, the broth was a little too salty so you may want to save the beef soup (and a drink) for the end of your meal!
We got the large portion and the amount of sliced beef provided was really generous. Furthermore, the beef was cooked to the right extent and it was rather tender. However, the dish was priced pretty steeply at $10.50++ and honestly, the overall serving size was a little small for the large portion.",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/2f33ba11c8ff9b5a16d81917092_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Meat was definitely good especially the beef balls as they gave 5 huge ones that had a very good bite to it. Shank was tender too. Broth was very salty so be prepared to feel very thirsty after eating it but I felt like it’s one of the reasons why it tasted so good and comforting. Chilli on the side is definitely necessary as it was sour and spicy to compliment the salty-umami bowl of noodle. Price was average but with the Burpple deal it made it very worth it.

Hup Heng Bedok 510 Prawn Noodle (445 Tampines),1 REVIEW,0 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$5/pax,Hawker Food,,Soup is Bland.. Was this an off day?,"Haven't had much luck with prawn noodles lately..... Read good reviews about Hup Heng Bedok 510 Prawn Noodle & it's also highly rated (4.8/5 stars) on Google Maps..... Was in the area so I decided to swing by over lunch to check it out.
Service was friendly & with a smile, but I was disappointed by how bland this soup tasted. There was no umaminess, nor was there a solid taste of seafood in the broth... It was just like, Idk, chicken stock? & to me, the broth has a huge part to play in a comforting bowl of prawn mee.
Ingredients-wise, they're not bad actually. The clams were plentiful & the prawns sizeable & fairly fresh. Topped with fragrant fried shallots, too. But the soup really lost me.
Did I come on a wrong day? Perhaps. I would hope so. Not that keen to return, too.... Unless it was super convenient again & I had no other options to consider.

Since I was craving it, I got this together with another bowl of spicy noodles to emulate a chilli dumpling oil noodle meal. (Fun fact: they seem to only have the oriental chilli oil wanton noodles in specific branches, one of which is the Jewel outlet). The ratio of vinegar to chilli oil was balanced. The dumplings, while on the smaller side, was wrapped with a smooth silky skin which encased a juicy ball of meat. While I paired this with noodles, I’m sure this complements the fried rice great as well, because of all the remaining sauce you can enjoy with it!

Good For Groups",,Review on Black Sesame Pau ($1.80),"The beautiful thing about this is you can order just one of this to try out.
It is a small and very beautifully-made pau. I can finish this off in two bites.
The pau has that fragrant pau smell that I so love. At first bite, there is a very very subtle hint of bitterness, but this is the only time you will taste that.
The remaining bites you take to finish the pau off will only make you love this pau; more with every subsequent bite. The sesame paste is not too oily nor too sweet. It is very fragrant and has a nutty taste. It looks slightly pastey, but is actually super smooth; not the watery kind that drips out like a lava flow. This is pure unadulterated and smooth sesame paste. Delicious!
The pau skin is not too thick. It is soft and slightly chewy (more chewy than most other pau skin elsewhere).
It is definitely one of the best black sesame (paste) paus I have tried, if not the best.",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/2f124612602196267dcc1645250_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Good For Groups",,Review on Steamed Chinese Style Layer Cakes 千层油糕 ($4 For 2pcs),"Din Tai Fung at Tampines Mall is highly popular. If you are dining in a big group, go very early (4plus in the afternoon) or very late (8plus). The peak hour is usually from 5-7plus in the evening. The queue is not too bad if you go in twos. But just be prepared to queue otherwise.
Tried out their traditional steamed layer cake for the first time. It is pale yellow in colour and the layers are clearly obvious, reminding me of kueh lapis (but definitely not as dense/ oily as kueh lapis).
The steamed layer cake here is moist, very soft, and I could peel the layers off, layer by layer. The cake is smooth, yet slightly chewy. The texture reminds me of warm bread that is still chewy, albeit a bit softer.
Subtly sweet, this is a delightful snack!",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/2f12461260205c5779921645244_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

According to him, the noodles here are made using only egg whites, so they're free of the pronounced alkaline taste characteristic of most yellow noodles — yay!

Delivery",,Signature Sarawak Kuching Kolo Mee [$4],"One of the few stalls with the longest queues in Tampines Round Market when we were there! This signature set comes with quite a variety of ingredients - vegetables, wanton, fried wanton, char siew and braised pork ribs, all atop a serving of curly noodles. Best component on the plate for me was the tender braised pork ribs. The noodles were a tad soft for my liking but still rather springy to the bite. Even though I wouldn’t say I’m a massive fan, it’s still a comforting and value for money option! #BurppleBestofTampines

I am not very sure on how authentic this kolo mee is to the original from Sarawak as what I had previously from other stalls contain only minced meat without the pork ribs and dumplings, but nonetheless, this is still a yummy bowl of noodles especially after you mixed in the chilli sauce that comes by the side.

But the unanimous pick was still the flavourful and tender chicken which overshadowed the char siew and roast duck due to their leaner cuts in my opinion.

Delivery",,Liu Sha Bao (takeaway 3 for $5.3),"I took away one set of liushabao, in the cold form, so I just had to steam this for a few minutes for my breakfast! Of course, it tasted really delicious as the salted egg custard was rich, creamy and smooth. One downside would be the ratio of bun to custard as I would prefer more salted egg. The size of the bun was quite small too for the price, but it was expected of a famous restaurant. Nevertheless, it was a good piece of liushabao that really satisfied me👌🏻",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/2f48ab0d2f14d5eb8e5a1827112_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Delivery",,Brunch time at Crystal Jade😋 So my mum and i decided to get some dimsum after a gym session🙂 total was $60.95!!,"Some food wasnt in here as they were the replica, such as the Chicken feet,and also we decided to takeaway 4 of their Prawn paste Chicken wings (each at $1.80) Tbh all of their Dimsums were good but i was really disappointed with the fried rice🙁 We got the Yang Chow fried rice ($14.80), when it first came, it smelled really good, but the taste of the fried rice so bland, that i felt i was just eating plain rice with char siew and shrimps.. So we told the staffs and well they managed to change a set of fried rice for us. Their service was superb! But i wouldn't go back for the fried rice again as there are so many BETTER ones out there with a much cheaper price👌 But overall their other food was really good😋

Shaped in a distinct pyramid-shape, their carrot cake is soft and moist. I like the generous portion of egg within, nice.
.
I like the black version, which is a little softer, with robust sweet savoury eggy flavour. The white version is tasty too, with savoury sweet eggy flavour. Both carry a hint of smoky aroma.
.
Their chili is punchy, with a sharp spicy kick, making this all the more delicious.

Didn’t get to try the porridge as I was told it was sold out. But I was surprised that the old couple (4th group) behind me managed to get a serving of porridge for takeaway. Seem quite double standard.

I went for medium level of spiciness (or, zhong la). Thought it was a good enough of spicy for the medium level, but thought it was way too numbing. Would have appreciated slightly less ma and perhaps more la here, but since it is soup based, I do think they all added up pretty well. I did find it a bit too salty and msg-laden, feeling especially thirsty after the meal.

King of Hong Kong Rice Roll (Tampines Mall),1 REVIEW,0 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$5/pax,"Kopitiam
Hawker Food",,Rice Roll with Dough Sticks,"HK-style Chee Cheong Fun had been all the rage ever since how Happy Congee has made freshly made-upon-order HK-style Chee Cheong Fun available to the masses — the wave of Chee Cheong Fun-centric establishments such as the likes of Cheong Fun Paradise, Chef Leung, Fei Chang Hao and Chef Wei HK Chee Cheong Fun had started to flood the F&B scene here.
A recent addition and one that has yet to be widely mentioned is King of Hong Kong Rice Roll (PS: has anyone noticed the trend of using “King of …” in an establishment’s name like King of Fried Rice and King of Pao Fan?) — one of the new stalls that has sprouted up in Kopitiam at Tampines Mall which serves up HK-style Chee Cheong Fun and Congee; the stall being described as being opened by “an ex-restaurant head chef” with “more than 30 years of experience”, and that “everything from the menu is said to be handmade”.
Thought I would give the Rice Roll with Dough Sticks a go first amongst all the items offered on the menu here since the items on the menu was pretty reminiscent of Happy Congee’s (yes, they also offer a Mala Shredded Chicken Rice Roll too). Perhaps my expectations have heightened over time, considering how I really liked the stone-milled variants from Rice & Roll and Chef Leung — that being said, the Rice Roll with Dough Sticks from King of Hong Kong Rice Roll still feels like it fell a little short in terms of flavour in general; even when compared with the same from Happy Congee. The rice rolls, whilst smooth and silky, seemed to have lacked the fragrance of the rice slurry; seemingly felt a little bland. This was even more prominent from the lack of soy sauce especially for the top-most pieces, considering how the soy sauce seems to be poured into the plate than over the rice rolls and tasted a little flat in its savouriness; missing out the slight sweetness that some soy sauces used in this dish would carry. It’s a real pity considering how I actually preferred the dough sticks used here; not overly toasty as it retains a crisp and chewy texture whilst not being overly greasy; the chili does help provide a savoury and umami note from dried shrimps however.
To be fair, the rendition of the Rice Roll with Dough Sticks at King of Hong Kong Rice Roll feels pretty decent — something which would work as a rather substantially-sized light lunch and one to solve those cravings for HK-style Chee Cheong Fun. It is just unfortunate how the competition has pretty much upped its game by quite a fair bit in a short span of time, and their rendition just doesn’t quite stand out against the others which have massively expanded, or in the midst of expanding their operations in the current time. Probably a stall that Tampines residents wouldn’t mind patronising for the convenience, but not one that I would make a special trip all the way out for to have.",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/1c299c9524f54fa6c721910218_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format
Jin Xi Lai (Mui Siong) Minced Meat Noodle (Tampines),4 REVIEWS,1 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$5/pax,Hawker Food,,Their Pig Liver Slices are indeed fresh!,"Known for their fresh pig liver slices, mui siong minced meat noodles indeed does have a certain standard. The pig liver slices in their Minced Meat Noodle ($5) were pretty thick and they were just lightly blanched. Although the small amount of blood left in the liver may be off putting to some, they were really fresh and soft and had little to no gaminess. The soup itself is actually on the sweeter side and I do wish for it to be more savoury.
The noodles were softer than usual, and the sauce seasoning used has a very old school taste! The vinegar is heavy in this one, and the chilli used has quite a bit of dried shrimp in them.

Warong Kim's Goreng Delights (Our Tampines Hub Hawker Centre),1 REVIEW,0 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$10/pax,"Hawker Food
Zi Char",,"On the day that I #letinstagramdecide for my lunch, the majority voted for hokkien mee over chicken rice, and hence, hokkien mee it shall be.","After doing quite a bit of research to find a hokkien mee that is relatively undiscovered, my search led to Warong Kim’s Goreng Delights, which is surprisingly a concept of Kim’s Famous Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee at Eunos. The original outlet is made famous by Mr Tan Kue Kim, who is distinguishable by the photo of him wearing a long sleeve shirt and a gold Rolex watch while frying the noodles. For this branch over at Tampines, Warong Kim’s serves the famous hokkien and other Chinese seafood dishes, all of which are halal-certified. Understandably, many people would frown at the thought that there is no pork lard in this, but if the wok hei and taste is able to trump over the addition of pork lard, I will gladly eat this anytime of the day, as many hokkien men stalls might have added pork lard but the overall taste is far from good. I am thoroughly satisfied from my decision as this takeaway packet of hokkien mee from Warong Kim’s, which is the wetter version, has all the essential elements of a good hokkien mee, from the wok hei to the slurp-worthiness of the noodles. Squeeze in the calamansi for that additional zing and mix in the sambal for a satisfying meal.

.
The standard version has fresh minced pork and pork loin slices, meaty sweet savoury in flavour.
.
But the main taste profile is the juicy braised mushrooms with vegetal earthy salty savoury herbal flavour, plus the braised egg which lends eggy salty sweet herbal notes.
.
Those who want bigger flavour can go for their other version, which also has the same delicious mushrooms, paired with braised minced pork and braised pork ribs instead.
.
The braised pork ribs are the highlight; incredibly tender and succulent, with robust depth of meaty salty savoury herbal taste, so good. These tend to sell out just after lunch, so going early is advised.

All the delicious descriptions that you can associate these braised pork ribs with can be found from this stall such as fall-off-the-bone tender, umami, gelatinous and super satisfying.

The sauce is important to get right. I was brought back on a trail of nostalgia with Teo Kee! The meat was very tasty from the dark sauce it was braising in for hours, and was falling off the bone! Wonderful balance of caramel sweetness and herbs. The chicken feet was great too, the skin was soft and gelatinous, falling off the bone. The sauce is different to that of the pork ribs, and had a little more of the ""Tang Gui"" angelica root aroma. This store has done it so well! The noodles were nothing to rave about, but it served as a platform for these wonderful pork ribs and chicken feet! Will come again!

Teo Kee Mushroom Minced Pork Noodle (Tampines Round Market),18 REVIEWS,34 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$5/pax,Hawker Food,,Pork ribs noodle This popular noodles serves very good pork ribs..,"The Meat is easily dismantle by your teeth and its very tender. Really shows how long they braised the meat! Streaks of tendon is left behind or if you are one of those who enjoy chewing it, there's plenty to go by. Sauce is more to the sweet side but it's very tasty and it's well season into the meat. I only wish there are more sauce infuse with the noodles! A lettuce is even thrown in for probably decoration purposes.. Oh the Soup is very tasty too! I finish mine before realizing I haven't taken the pic yet!
8/10👍🏽

Pasta",,Wrong order? Bad service,"Ordered their lychee elderflower spritzer as I rmb that I liked it a lot from the last visit. To my disappointment, it's totally diff from the last time I ordered in terms of both appearance and taste. There is no taste of elderflower at all,unlike the last time.
When I heard the waitress saying ""lychee elderflower"" to the next table as she delivered it to the table, I saw that the appearance is totally different. There is a stick of 2 lychees on top of the drink. So I asked the customer at the next table if that is lychee elderflower, and they said yes.
So I told the waitress about it. She asked if I was talking about the glass. I replied ""I mean, just look, mine don't even have any lychee"". She asked me to hold on. After a while, another guy came to send me 2 lychees. Nobody came back to address the issue... THE PROBLEM IS NOT THE LACK OF 2 LYCHEES!!!",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/1690632755_review_image1973697_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

There is a ongoing promotion for takeaway now hence this meal for 2pax cost about $28 (including GST).
250g doesn’t sound much but was really full at the end of the meal and wasn’t able to finish the sides as well!! Opted for the steak to cook to medium rare and they did it perfectly. The steak was juicy and not tough at all. In fact we had to chew off the meat since it was sliced. Really loved the mac & cheese despite it looking so simple. There was a pronounced cheese taste to it and it was creamy as well. Was a little disappointed with the buttered broccoli as it seemed to be boiled broccoli with some butter liquid. It still taste nice but expected a little more.
Overall, the deal was very worth it since it works out to be $14 each. Would recommend it!!",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/5d2ea14bc59f75d9ac61856019_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Pasta",,Ribeye [20++],"again, opted for the smaller 200g cut and it was filling enough - maybe also due to the accompaniment of 2 complimentary sides that were well portioned (though the picture may not look so)!! comparing this to the striploin, I actually prefer the latter because it had a higher ratio of fats which I personally feel adds to the meat’s flavour and makes it more tender as well hahah! but this was also cooked perfectly to my request of medium and had a wonderful texture as well! the mac & cheese was pretty unique as well; the cheese used tasted slightly different and better than usual mac&cheese from other places!",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/2f3eb4506ed77f5b94b41829173_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

I requested for the meat to be cooked till medium and to my delight it was served with a nice outer sear while its interior was still slightly pink - just what I wanted 😍 the meat was tender and easy to cut through yet still chewy and I love that it wasn’t totally lean and had some fats to contribute to its flavour. I opted for an herb butter sauce and LOVED IT!!! fragrant and buttery, it combined with the beef juices and elevated to whole dish. the free sides made my meal feel even more worth it as they were substantially portioned.

Pasta",,Massive Steak Dinner,"Had these meats all by myself today.
The 250g ribeye was well worth the price of 24 dollars, and came with my favourite cafe de paris sauce. Was done medium rare and well seared which ensured a crisp texture. It was pretty good. Tender, flavourful, juicy, but nothing too amazing.
The 250g Flat Iron on the other hand, was really so- so, I suggest you go without it, even though it's cheap ($18). Since flat iron steak is one of the tougher cuts, its hard to do it well. Unfortunately for MediumRare by Saveur, they failed to meet my expectation of a good steak. It was robust in flavour no doubt, but extremely hard to chew on. Trust me, you'd have an aching jaw by the end of your meal. You'd be better off ordering their Sirloin ($18) for 200g. Really hope MediumRare gets their Flat Iron steak sorted out.
The sides were done decently, nothing special. The creamed spinach was light on the palate, and the coleslaw ensured freshness and was a nice contrast to cut through the richness of the steak.
Overall I'd rate : 3.5/5. Service was excellent definitely. However, it's rather unlikely that I will come again.",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/3053d7ba0f7d30d3771a1786874_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Pasta",,Delicious & Worth It!,"Ordered the Flat Iron which comes with 2 sides and a sauce all for $18. I got a medium steak and it was really juicy with a nice crust on the top. Really enjoyed my steak! Closest experience I’ve had to the famous Flat Iron chain in London.
For my sides, I got creamed spinach and the beef fat fried rice. The spinach was a little on the creamy side but I personally enjoy it! I previously read comments about how the beef fat fried rice was overhyped and lacking in flavour. However, I found this to be completely untrue. The beef fat fried rice was full of flavour and very 香. Initially, I thought the sides were a bit small portion wise, but after eating them I realised it was just right. Tried the Mac n Cheese that my mum ordered and it’s to die for! Really high quality and yummy. Would recommend these three sides for sure.
Sauce wise, my mum and I both got the Cafe de Paris sauce which was described as a lemon and herb sauce. This is very accurate as it was incredibly citrusy. Good sauce but I just don’t think it goes very well with the steak. Would probably work better with chicken.
Ambience here is lovely. All in all a wonderful lunch experience! And all that for $18? Really worth it.",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/30891c0a6e59da5352ec1778698_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Short of photoshopping the whole dish there isn't much I can, or am willing to, do to tzsuj it up. Let's start with the meat: both his ribeye and my flat iron cuts were cooked way over our requested doneness. My medium-rare to medium came as a shocking medium-well — almost well-done actually. Kudos for seasoning their steak well, but the bad cook on the steaks were really unforgivable especially on a cut as lean as my flat iron. Don't get me started on the sides. ""Creamed spinach"" was more blanched spinach (with its accompanying water) mixed with a touch of cream; ""beef fat rice"" was basically just rice with a bit of colour and seasoning; ""parmesan corn"" was hard and cold grated parmesan over cold corn sitting in water (seriously aren't these two components supposed to yknow bind together); and brussel sprouts was aight. Yes the prices are low (mine's $18 for 250g), but looking at their contemporaries like Featherblade and even Aston's really, affordability shouldn't encroach on quality.",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/36a9dab90d35362c5941775437_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Pasta",,Flat Iron Steak,"From MediumRare by Saveur at Century Square; essentially a revamp to FrapasBar by Saveur — the brand now focusing on serving up different cuts of steak at affordable prices.
Coming in a 250g portion, the Flat Iron Steak is pretty accessible to most with its price of $18++. Ordering our Flat Iron Steak to be served medium-rare, the steak comes pinkish within, and is still pretty tender and succulent without having much of a need to chew. Every order is entitled to a free sauce and two sides; our choice of sauce being the Cafe de Paris which is essentially a knob of herb butter that is garlicky and buttery — complements the steak really well. Our side of the Beef Fat Fried Rice was a comforting rendition of an egg fried rice; aptly savoury though could be a little bit greaser for better texture, while the Creamed Spinach is not doubt comforting with the cream sauce cutting through the ""greenness"" of the leaves. A pretty value for money eat.",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/1c299c6e19b6d36a3e61764079_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Pasta",,"@mediumraresg For those looking for a good steak without having to blow a hole in your pocket, then ure in luck as Medium Rare serves affordable and quality steaks!","This 250g Angus Ribeye Steak hits all the right spots for me as it’s meat is succulent, tasty and filling too! I like the option of having to choose your own sides too as onion rings and some kind of veg would make the perfect candidate!
🔻
Want a different cut? Then how about the tenderloin which does looks smaller but it’s thick piece of solid meat! Pair them up with the sides of your choice to complete the meal!
🔻
Of course everyone will have different preference when it comes to the doneness of the beef but basically if there’s a choice, I will always recommend Medium Rare..🙃🔹

Pasta",,"Flat Iron Steak (250g, $18), includes 2 side dishes @mediumraresg .",".
A steakhouse by Saveur has open in Century Square Mall Tampines. I am excited to see Flat Iron cuts starting to gain popularity in Singapore.
.
My flat iron is cooked perfectly to medium rare as per order, delivering a tender, juicy, springy texture. The best part is that you won't taste fatty, almost like filet mignon cut. For sauce, I choose Cafe de Paris / herb butter topping.
.
Sides are creamy spinach and beef fats fried rice. The creamy spinach is tasty with a light touch of cream. While the beef fats fried rice tasted more like a butter rice salad with beef fats. Rich, tasty flavoured rice, with crispy beef fats.
.
CBK Opinion: A must visit steak place in Tampines. The steak is yummy and the side dishes also delicious. Plus, it is pocket friendly as well. Will return for the famous Saveur Duck Confit next time.

This is not the first time visit this restaurant, but it is disappointed in this time😞, we ordered four main dishes, shrimp paste chicken nasi lemak had not much meat and felt oily; in addition, the fried fish has a heavy fishy smell, which is difficult to swallowed.

Nasi Lemak",,Nasi Lemak with Prawn Paste Chicken,"Visited The White Tiffin recently; the F&B establishment having moved from Fragrance Empire Building to its new premises at Changi City Point. Serving up their famed Nasi Lemak, the menu also sees a variety of other Noodle and Rice offerings, such as Curry Chicken and Laksa as well, alongside with cakes and desserts (including the Soya Beancurd Tart that seems to be supplied by Le Cafe).
Really enjoyed the Nasi Lemak they have to offer; coming with other elements such as Ikan Bilis, Peanuts, Achar and Salted Egg Fish Skin, the Nasi Lemak here is one that comes with quite a number of accompaniments on the side. The Nasi Lemak here comes infused with Blue Pea Flower to carry that blue hue; otherwise, the rice was pretty fluffy and carried a nice hint of fragrance from the coconut — distinct, yet light. The portion of the Prawn Paste Chicken is pretty generous; the fried batter being all crisp while the flesh itself was juicy and succulent, carrying a umami flavour from the prawn paste used in its marination — the flavours being on point and well-expected for what it seems to suggest. Carrying its signature hint of sweetness, the chili is the sort that is typically served with Nasi Lemak yet carrying a moderate level of spiciness that tingles the tastebuds. Other elements like the Ikan Bilis and Salted Egg Fish Skin were crispy like they should; none of the limp, aired-out ones that one may get at a coffeeshop because they were sitting at the counter for too long, while the Achar came peanut-free (yay for me!) and carried a refreshing crunch that gives a good break from the heavier elements. Had always been wanting to try them out after reading multiple articles on them; a great eat that I would consider having in the area, and something which I would most certainly wish to have again!",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/1c299c753d252addc721806631_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Their hearty renditions also see a huge slab of chicken cutlet instead of the familiar chicken wings when you order the Signature Chicken Nasi Lemak and a pretty premium option of Lobster Nasi Lemak XXL!
Plated out very nicely, I had the Signature Fried Fish Nasi Lemak ($7.50) which switches up the standard fried fish to battered fish. Not overly greasy or cloying, the batter was a tad too thick for me but the flesh within was kept soft and moist. Milder in coconut milk flavour, the fluffy blue rice was sufficiently fragrant and well-executed. The crunchy components - achar, ikan bilis, peanuts and papadum were decent too. Hence, overall, an indulgent medley and a dish I would reserve for those ‘treat yourself day’ kind of experience!",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/38aafc3d2cab6d246b21658335_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Nasi Lemak",,Tiffin is defined as some kind of a lunch box.,"◽◾
There are different sets and I chose the assam fish with veges and prawn rolls. All of which came in individual tiffins. The big plate is their signature nasi lemak. The assam fish had a smoky aftertone and tangy. Prawn rolls alittle sweet. The blue pea rice was slightly fluffier than the white rice.
◽◾
I do adore the cute mini tiffins. Came together with the metal holder, it was a quirky presentation. Food had hits and misses. But it will certainly fill your tummy. For their opening promo, a bowl of green bean soup is complimentary till end of this week.

My absolute favourite & go-to whenever I’m craving for affordable yet delicious chirashi bowl: @keikaisendon.sg.
Here’s why I love them:
1) They have outlets all over the island!
2) Great quality for the affordable price, you even get side dishes (different for each outlet), miso soup that’s loaded with seaweed, clams and bits of salmon & salad tossed in Japanese sesame sauce
3) A variety of mains on their menu to choose from. I always go for either the signature or mentaiyaki bowl, but I visited before P2HA with a friend who doesn’t eat raw fish & it was fine since there are so many other cooked mains to choose from!

Kathi roll originated from India, where they found the trend of wrapping kebab with layer of prata.

Vouchers",,Their dishes were delicious!,"Saw that the dishes in Banjara Restaurant were on #burpplebeyond, and decided to do a takeaway! Some of my favourites were:
Chicken Tikka Masala ($19.90) - absolutely loved the sauce that is rich in garlic, onion and spice flavours that gave it a bold savoury touch. Chicken pieces were tender as well. Perfect with naan or rice 😍
Butter Chicken ($19.90) - if you love a sweeter touch, this is for you! Their butter chicken had such a rich bold curry that is really addictive! In fact, it wasn't too surfeiting and I love to soak my naan in such a delicious sauce!
Garlic Naan ($4.90) - I think among the cheese, garlic and butter naan, this is the best. The garlic butter will elevate whatever curry you dip it in!
Honestly, found the dishes rather expensive without the 1 for 1, but with the discount I really don't mind having it again 😍",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/1653231925_review_image1939461_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Price: $3.60 for donut, $3.50 for cinnamon roll (not sure if it's cheaper because of mass buy)
my school organised sales for puffs and peaks which is all the way in tampines so it was a must buy for me I got chocolate donut, lemon custard donut and a cinnamon roll
had covid so I didn't eat it fresh I ate it a day or two old so my review can take w a pinch of salt 🧂
ate the cinnamon roll first and it was rly up my alley swipe for cross section idk how cinnamon rolls are suppose to be but the bread is really brioche like vv soft but I like the top crunchy part the most and the nuts on top actually was q a good addition
but puffs and peaks famous for donuts so for choco donut honestly I think it's quite good it has A LOT of filling so it's dem satisfying when u are craving something sweet friend 1 says it's too sweet for me I think it's acceptable cus donut = sweet to me 👍 the lemon custard one is a bit more refreshing cus the sourness sort of cuts out the greasiness but I would prefer the chocolate one cus the lemon custard one is quite an acquired taste ngl for the donuts overall I find them a bit greasy but for donuts I guess it's alright
overall a satisfying experience esp since I have been hearing about them for the longest time definitely did not disappoint would buy again if it was convenient 🍩🍩",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/1667304742_review_image1954342_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

I’m not a east-ie so @puffsandpeaks is way too far from me😢 With just a touch of my fingers, I’m able to get these floofy donuts 🍩 delivered right to my doorstep🚪 + $5 OFF WHEN I USED THE CODE “FOODYDESSERTS” before checking out‼️
I was literally rejoicing! Now I don’t have to travel all the way to Tampines to get my sugary donut 🍩 cravings fixed 🤭 Heard 👂🏻 sooo many good reviews on @puffsandpeaks & had to try it for myself!😁
Finally bought it since @puffsandpeaks was on @pickupp.sg 🥳
Doughnuts / Donuts⁉️🤣🤣🤣
The donuts 🍩 were all very floofy, pillowy soft & most importantly, wasn’t greasy at all😋 It’s stuffed with generous amounts of filling😚 & was exploding as I tried tearing it🙈
@puffsandpeaks did their tea series really well😉 Tea 🫖 lovers, I’m sure you’ll love it too!!!❤️
My favourite was definitely the matcha!!!🍵 Enjoyed the robust matcha 🍵 flavour, you could taste 👅 that distinct earthiness with a rich umami & bittersweet profile🫶🏻 Not cloying👍🏻
Earl Grey also had a slightly bitter tea 🫖 taste 👅 with a slight nutty and milky undertone but very fragrant!👃🏻 You could even 👀 specks of tea leaves 🍃 incorporated into the cream🙌🏻
For the Hazelnut Praline Chocolate 🍫 and Blackcurrant Peanut 🥜 Butter🧈 donut, loved that nuttiness that came through😛 Wished that there’s more of that fLoWyY-crunchy peanut 🥜 butter 🧈 for the Blackcurrant Peanut Butter donut 🍩 though🥲 it was rlly yummyy but otherwise, that tartness from the jam complimented really well with the rich peanut butter 🧈
Vanilla donut & Chocolate 🍫 were the most classic idt you can ever go wrong with this!✌🏻

Flavours of their signature brioche donuts ($3.80) rotate regularly - we got matcha this time! Their donuts are wondrously fluffy with a great chew. I thought the tea flavour was a tad lacking, but appreciated that it had a faint hint of bitterness that balanced its sweet vessel.
It was our first time trying their other bakes - some had already sold out by lunch time, so we settled for the yuzu pear crumble ($5.50). It’s cake edges held well, but its base was a little soggy. Wished the crumble was more crisp to provide textural variation! Otherwise, the citrus fragrance rounded by a muted sweetness comes across well.
Lastly, we tried their highly raved cold brew ($5) which had been steeped for 5 days. The coffee is clean and sharp with a fruity flavour that leans towards acidic.

thankfully the pistachio cake fared better. very moist and dense but still acceptable. also loved the crunch from the pistachio bits! however the lemon syrup made the cake too sweet, would probably appeal more to those with sweet tooths!

Bread & Pastries",,Lovely Donuts,"These donuts have been highly raved and hard to get since they were a home based business and now that they have evolved to an actual shop, they are still pretty elusive 😂
Luckily, I managed to snag a box of these soft and airy donuts showered with sugar granules. How they managed to hold the generous amount of custard cream within them is beyond me because they simply exploded when I tried to tear them into half. The texture of the cream was consistent throughout, smooth, velvety and cool ('cause I took it out of the fridge and I must say, it tasted better that way)
I started off with the Vanilla, which was a good choice considering how its fragrance was the lightest of all despite the prominent use of vanilla beans. Mild and subtle, this was really light on the palate and you could easily devour one yourself without feeling bogged down by it. Right on the other spectrum is its Chocolate counterpart, which was much richer and aromatic without being cloyingly sweet.
I enjoyed the Taro Coconut, where the faint taro scent gently perfumed your nose as you leaned in to take a bite, though I personally felt that it could be a little sweeter to allow the taro to shine through.",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/3921a41ff382bd16c1a1889427_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Bread & Pastries",,Assorted Bakes,"If the cheesy saying “Everyday is Valentine's Day When You Are with The Right Person” is true, why express your affection with greetings when you can say it with edible gifts?! Spelling love with their handcrafted bakes, Puffs and Peaks’ fluffy yeasted donuts were just as good as I remembered them to be! Think silky smooth chocolate custard, earthy Hojicha cream, velvety orh nee, and my new favourite, Passionfruit curd piped generously into the pillowy perfection. With just the right amount of zing, the curd had a very bright sweetness that went superbly well with the flavour of the dough.
And having their brownies for the first time, I think I am in love! The Hazelnut Praline Brownie was a foolproof combination with a strong dose of nuttiness from the layer of hazelnut paste atop. Distinct yet not overpowering, the hazelnut swirls didn’t take away the decadence of the moist dark cocoa brownie and instead added a very nice fragrance that wasn’t cloying at all.  
Having the best of both worlds, their Classic Brookie takes a regular chocolate chip cookie and marries it to a dark cocoa brownie for the ultimate treat! The classic half being buttery and semi-sweet while the other spots a more intense chocolatey aroma. But overall, the cookie had a lovely chew as well as a soft and fudgy bite. The melty Valrhona dark chocolate also providing that extra bittersweet oomph to tie the half-and-half cookie together.
All in all, a heartfelt thank you to the @puffsandpeaks team for sending your artisanal bakes my way!",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/38aafc6b18767db100e1885974_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

i’ve been seeing bombolonis/stuffed donuts pop-up all over my feed lately and i just had to try some from @puffsandpeaks.
they have some pretty interesting flavours featured & it’s changed up weekly too! grabbed 3/4 flavours the week i visited.
🍩 the donut: light yet bready and sturdy enough to hold the delicious custard held within. definitely not greasy either! honestly, i would’ve preferred the donut without the sugar crystals or replaced with a light dusting of powdered sugar instead.

🍋 lemon donut: a new flavour that was out when i visited! oh man the custard for this one was so tart and very lemony, those who love lemon flavours will not be disappointed.
🍦vanilla donut: look! at! the! vanilla! beans! this flavour really let the oh-so-creamy and velvety custard shine through. nothing vanilla about this one 😉
my favourites were a tie between the vanilla bean & hojicha donuts, but the lemon was really enjoyable too!
the donuts here are quite pricey but i didn’t mind since it was a treat & it’s always great to support new & small local businesses popping up in the neighbourhood.
will pay another visit to try their other delicious bakes next time! if you’re planning to visit, be ready to queue about 20 minutes & check their instagram for updates on what’s available!

They switch up their offerings slightly every week, and the first flavours of 2021 are hot favourites. The vanilla is a constant mainstay and its easy to see why – the all-natural vanilla fragrance from the cool, creamy custard is simply heavenly. Matcha lovers will definitely fall for the intense, astringent green tea flavour of the matcha donut, and the taro coconut is perhaps the mildest amongst the three, with a mild sweetness that lets the yam and coconut shine through.

Of course my mum loves donuts and the filled with stuffing ones here get her nod of approval, $3.80 for a piece is no means cheap but comparable to other boutique bakeries I’ve heard about.

My verdict: carry the persona of a home baker turned casual cafe, this was truly top percentile home baking, cakes with moist sponge, quite a bit of aeration and simple frosting.

As seen just like @stormscape I didn’t make it for the donuts too😂 highly recommended to go early☺️ and check their insta for updates (travelled all the way to the east Haiz)😭 but still managed to get the LAST slice of Pear choco loaf
and their brookie both from quality @valrhona_asia chocolates 🍫 I do like the pear addition to the loaf which balances the sweetness with natural fruity texture and flavor 🍐 the brookie is just beautiful with that half-half marble look✨ buttery and crisp! You can ask them to heat them up if you are dining in☺️ - only 8 seats available!😜 hopefully will be back again for their donuts when I’m in the area😅

🍜 This is the branch of the famous old airport road lor Mee. It includes, 1 whole braised egg, generous portions of braise pork, pork belly, shredded fish, bean sprouts and parsley. Chilli and minced garlic is a must. Unfortunately there's no chopped chilli to go with(personal preference). The fish is fresh and firm. I love the texture. I believe it's batang fish. The pork is nicely braised. The pork belly is sliced a little too thin in my opinion, it's almost as thin as the noddles.
Besides the same ingredient used, is there any difference you may ask. I must say the atmosphere and somehow it's missing the old school taste of the original store. Maybe this branch is too nicely renovated and clean. It lacks the rusticness of the original store. Nevertheless, it is still a good bowl of Lor Mee.",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/33f3b3f3fd2a7b0f19e81926406_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

We also had the Gekikara Ramen, which uses the same thick tonkotsu broth but spiced up with their homemade spicy miso and spicy minced pork, the additions transformed the entire slurping experience. All in all, two very comforting bowls of ramen noodle that will help satisfy those cravings.

All in all, we surprisingly enjoyed the food, especially the Spicy Yuzu Ramen. To prove it, I actually managed to finish the addictive broth and wiped the bowl clean.😉 Special mention goes out to their slurp-a-licious noodles, which have a nice, satisfying texture. Their runny Ajitsuke Tamago were great too, though I felt that they could be marinated longer…

Japanese",,Kotteri Tonkotsu Ramen [$16.90 for Regular],"First bowl we went for was their signature original tonkotsu broth. The regular bowl came with 3 slices of belly chashu, fungus strips, spring onion, hanjuku egg and 2 pieces of nori. There’s also the basic bowl at $14.90 that doesn’t have egg and has less 1 piece of nori, while the special bowl at $18.90 that has 4 slices of the chashu and 1 piece of tokudai nori.
Found this a bit underwhelming for the price unfortunately. While the broth was comforting and had a nice thickness to it, thought it lacked a little oomph, hence it felt a bit flat after a while. Wasn’t a big fan of their belly chashu for they had a more hard-chewy sort of texture. Noodles had a good bite though and egg was flavourful. Think you can also request for lighter/stronger broth and softer/firmer noodles if you prefer!",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/1cf99ae38ff64d5dca01916599_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Thai",,Pork Basil Rice,"Read up a little about this nondescript store at Tampines which was opened for a couple of months now, and had a decent level of expectations prior to visiting. Pork basil rice is a staple of Thai cuisine and a dish that any decent Thai place should be able to master. Sad to say that I quite disappointed - at $6 a plate is this hawker place, it’s not cheap for the place. The minced pork which was stirred fry in a sweet sauce, was dry and lacking in flavor. What most striking was that, it lacks the most important essence of the dish: basil 🌿! Spice wise, it grows on you with each bite. Overall, disappointing.

Thai",,Thanks to @misstamchiak for recommending this hidden gem that we can finally have the original Jane Thai’s food again.,"Jane, the chef in the kitchen, has reopened her stall in Tampines and she will be cooking up a host of familiar Thai dishes for her diners. I just couldn’t resist not ordering the Basil Pork with Rice ($6) and this comes with a fried egg. Definitely not for those who cannot handle the heat, we took a peek from the corner of our eyes to see how Jane fries up the basil pork and it comes with lots of cut chillies. I was truly satisfied with my meal, even after sweating buckets, and we will definitely be back for the Prawn Cakes and other dishes in the menu!

Thai",,"Since it is Songkran weekend, I decided on Thai for lunch and went to a stall recommended by Miss TamChiak.","(Also it’s just across the road from my place.)
Nimman Soi 5 has been around for a while, but I’ve always known it as a mookata place. Now I find out it was also a great place for home style Thai comfort food too.
It’s own by the woman behind the former Jane Thai restaurant at Orchard Towers, and she has all her signatures here, including this damn shioks prawn cake ($10 for 4). I didn’t know what to order so got myself a Tang hoon (flavour packed, and so much prawns) and my fave Thai dish, minced pork omelette. Tbh the pics are not pretty but the taste, it’s like I’m back in Bangkok.
The tomyum looks legit, the fish too (other people ordered, I peeked) and I read that the Chiangmai sausage is a must try.
So I Guess I’ll be back there soon!
PS: HAPPY SONGKRAN TO ALL MY THAI FRIENDS!!!
PPS: location tag says Nimman Soi 9. Dunno if it’s the same stall but the address is correct - 21 Street Eating House at Blk 201 Tampines St 21.

Hougang Liu Tiao Shi,1 REVIEW,2 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$5/pax,Hawker Food,后港六条石,I am so happy to have found this hidden gem that is located within a coffeeshop in the neighourhood of Tampines Street 11.,"For fans of fried hokkien mee, you are either Team Dry or Team Wet, and for most places, the drier version usually has more wok hei in the noodles than the wetter ones. Over at 后港六条石 or Hougang Liu Tiao Shi, theirs is more of a wet fry hokkien prawn mee and for the price point of $5, you are really getting your money’s worth with two full prawns, slices of pork belly and squid with a mixture of fried yellow noodles and rice vermicelli. The uniqueness about this plate is that they added in cuts of spring onion and heaps of pork lard for the extra crunch and flavour. From the first glance of the saucy broth, you can actually see that it is of a darker tone, which prepares you for the wok hei that you are going to get. Mix well with the sambal chilli to give it a nice heat and enjoy the slurp from each spoonful.

.
While slightly smaller in size than elsewhere, each piece has a crisp chicken skin, and tender moist chicken meat which pulls away easily from the bone.
.
Carries good smoky meaty savoury spice flavour, with a hint of ginger from the marinade, nice.

In addition, based on personal preference, we can customize our maki roll. Have always been a fan of avocado and unagi 🙆🏻‍♀️ 📍Maki-San

Hawker Food",,Soya Sauce Chicken,"The quality of this soya chicken is slightly below average. In a plate of soya chicken, we expect the meat to be moist, succulent, and the skin to provide a salty but very much fragrant taste to the otherwise plain tasting white meat. The white meat on this chicken is a little too dry for my liking though, and does not soak up the gravy well enough due to its toughness.

Glad that this time round I can show you better pictures of how to make full use of your hotplate and the spams of seafood we had.🤤🦀🦞🦐🦑
Work hard now to deshell for a hassle free and easy eating later. Load up the hotplate so you can constantly eat while cooking your food. Had the Tom Yum soup this time round, but sad to say the Tom Yum taste got diluted overtime and become seafood soup.🤡 Just stick to chicken soup will do.
Satisfy ourselves with the ice cream buffet after having seafood buffet.😍🍧 Look at how much cup we have.😁 Truly tastisfying and food coma.

Sorry, my picture here may not do justice but the amount of seafood refill that I have was unmeasurable. Okay, maybe only a plate of seafood that was left behind while i took the whole tray over.🤭
With the hitz items, like crayfish, scallop, flower crab and prawns, one can whacked it to their heart content. People be like taking faster than the store can refill lor but all was worth it. Good thing is they refill quite fast also.🦀🦞🦐🦑
There is also a bowl of complimentary live prawn freshly scooped out from their mini tank.🦐
Now for the cooking, spread the margarine on the big hot plate and placed the raw food on it. But before that, if you are lazy and want to eat faster, best to get someone to de-shell those seafood before cooking for a better eating experience. Plus, the hot melted margarine can straight away fused the flavour to the meat itself.
Hotpot in the middle is superb. Had either chicken stock or Tom Yum as base and then start throwing delicious stuff into it. Flavours only gets stronger overtime thanks to the great amount of seafood in it. A oceanic sweet umami taste.🥰
Wait! Don't go yet! They also got free flow cooked food and ice cream too. Cooked food were normal tho, maybe cause cold already. The mingo ice cream is solid and many flavour to choose from. Rare to find lychee flavour over there too.💥
If you feel buffet is not enough, they do have some ala carte item to cook upon request. Feel free to check out.
Bet you all want to know the price badly, so just scroll down and see it. Its quite affordable for a cheap and quality for the price seafood buffet.
Can't wait to be back again with some makan kaki.😍

Timbre+ has so much good food so it was hard for me to choose a place to eat, but I'm pretty happy that I went for Ishiro because it is BUSSIN.
The chashu pieces are suuuuuper tender and full of flavour, not like those cheap hard kinds you find anywhere. The egg is so flowy. Yall know how much i love those smexy flowy eggs. Theres also a side of crispy fried tempura flour, which makes the whole dish even more delectable.
Would certainly return for this! Tastes super restaurant quality!

I love the ayuthaya-based it’s savoury sweet which is a hard to acquire taste🤤💕 do give it a try - boat noodles are my new noodle indulgence☺️

Thai boat noodle. Very minute portion in each bowl. Two kinds of broth.. pathumthani which was dark soya sauce base and ayutthaya, a somewhat creamy and atad spicy broth. Comes with beef or chicken. As you can see, ingredients are like miniscule. One person can finish the four bowls. We preferred the pathumthani for its more flavorful aromatic broth.

Indian",,Go-to Indian Rojak,"Yet another gem in Tampines, Al Mahboob Rojak was the bomb and certainly worth the travel. And having Indian Rojak for the first time, I carried the expectation of having my tongue burnt off from the fiery red sauce (really intimidating) but was pleasantly surprised by its savoury nature. Thick, sweet and nutty with just a tickle of spice in the blend; the flavourful sauce was a nice balance and highly addictive. Couple that with crispy dough fritters (can’t go wrong with all the fried items), crunchy sliced cucumber and chewy tentacles; and you got yourself a winner. Super shiok, Al Mahboob would make a great late night supper spot if it did open till midnight as the air-conditioned store was almost full-house at early dinner time on a weekday and I could definitely see why.

Indian",,Indian Rojak I don't eat a lot of rojak but this popular rojak just got my vote.,"Its texture is perfect and one could understand why it took a while to serve as the cooks need to expertly re-fry to give you that all important crunch and crispyness! There's a huge inventory of rojak ranging from many varieties of doughs, fitters, potato, and some chicken/fish. The sauce I feel is not out of the world. Quite mild I would say but whose to complain when it compliments my tapered fried goodies!

Beng Poh Eating House may seem out of the way, but their food items were pretty awesome! Here are the food items we ordered:
Salted Egg Pork Ribs ($15) - now this one really was the star of the show. Tender pork ribs, incredibly flavourful and rich salted egg sauce. Very well done.
Three Egg Spinach ($12) - this came in a claypot, and the broth was so flavourful! You get the extra sweetness from the red dates and the umami from the ikan billis.
Clam Bee Hoon ($10) - this was the medium size and they were quite generous with the portion. Thought not very heavily flavoured, you still get some smokiness and seafood flavours from the broth. Not bad but maybe we could have gotten it smaller and tried other dishes.

I am no Char Kway Teow lover but I can't believe I have actually had it for two days in a row for breakfast (unhealthy, but this wouldn't last long) — the Char Kway Teow comes with that incredible wok hei that gives the slurpy and savoury noodles so much flavour apart from the slight hint of spiciness it carries.

They're known for serving a clear broth with balanced peppery savoury garlicky spice flavour, pleasant enough to drink for all ages, yet sharp enough to tingle the palate.

Their pork ribs are among the most tender and succulent in texture, pulling nicely off the bone, with meaty sweet savoury flavour. Also love their tenderloin pork slices, which are super tender.

The pickled salted mustard greens have a light juicy crunch with vegetal salty sweet flavour, pairing well with the soft white rice with grainy sweet notes.

Good For Groups",,SAMSUI GINGER CHICKEN,"This was my first visit to Teahouse by Soup Restaurant and I am or actually we are pretty taken aback at how it tastes. We tried their best seller SAMSUI ginger chicken, fried beancurd skin, custard bao, claypot tofu, crispy prawn cheong fun and charsiew bao(baked).
Yes they sound super ordinary but gurllll I'm hooked to them flavours.
Samsui chix (best seller) is already a given that its really popular & delicious even among other burpplers.
Their crispy prawn cheong fun was very similar to the one I had at HKG. Ofc hkg was way better in terms of taste but I will return to teahouse to order this again. Worth the try i would say if you like so crispness rather than ur usual cheong fun texture!
Custard bao was EXTREMELY EXTREMELY soft... (you know how some baos their sauce is extremely good but the bao itself is pretty tough?) This custard bao from teahouse is different. Both the sauce and the bao is amazing.
Their claypot tofu was very different from the ones you would find at a tzechar stall. My family loved it given the fact that it wasn't too sweet neither too salty! Just a perfect dish for the pallette.
Their fried beancurd skin was bomb though there was quite qbit of residual oil on our plate from the beancurd skin. But it was rlly amazing!
However, of all good things there must be things to improve on right. Don't get me wrong it's still worth the visit. Their charsiewbao(baked) was very sweet tho. Just not what we had expected.
All in all, I would recommend my friends and I would return to TEAHOUSE by SOUP RESTAURANT.",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/3031da5c4535055114901890646_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

You can bet that its finger lickin’ good as I was licking the sauce off my fingers, the heat was truly addictive. For people who love their spice, this is definitely right up your alley as the already hot & crispy chicken has been given an additional boost in the spiciness. If the heat is too much to handle, you can always cool off with the SJORA Strawberry Kiwi or Pepsi.

The Cheese was creamy, light and more liquid than the one from Bake. The Chocolate on the other hand was a disaster. We didn't like how it tasted as it felt like ""fake"" and diluted Chocolate, such a waste of our Stomach's space.

We reccomend the Original Hokkaido Baked Cheese Tart but Bake Cheese Tart definitely win hands down!

Soup",,Ginseng Herbal Chicken Soup | $14.80,"The ginseng herbal chicken soup has a thick, authentic broth which I recommend sharing. This is especially because the soup composition gets thicker and sweeter as you drink it. Furthermore, you get to refill the soup a maximum of one time, which is still pretty worth it as the portion is good for sharing. I was hoping for the texture to be thinner and for it to be less sweet, but if you prefer a thick sweetness, then this would be good for you. The portion of chicken inside was decent as well. I personally would not come back here for my ginseng herbal chicken fix, but I would definitely come back for their other soups — particularly the ones brewed with pork ribs.

A good thing about this fried rice was that it was not too oily, and in fact, less oily than almost everyone's go-to DTF fried rice. However, I thought that it was a bit bland and not very flavourful. It might taste a bit dry at times, but it is alright if you eat it together with your soup combination and the other dishes. Overall, it was mot a plate of fried rice which stood out amongst others.

The Nest Restaurant.
If you are near Singapore Expo area come and dine at this classy restaurant which now opens to the public facing the beautiful golf course.
The restaurant served both local and western dishes. This grilled salmon is done beautifully. The skin crispy and the meat soft and juicy. This is available for the coming Christmas.
The other local dishes like laksa and fried kuay teow are also highly recommended. The new Dusit Hotel will be opening next year. We rate this restaurant 8.5/10. Good to visit again.

These bamboo clams were succulent and fresh but if you're not a fan of sour food, definitely DO NOT go for the garlic kumquat sauce. The pricks of citrusy sourness is too much for the average person to bear.",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/2f61039257bce3d06f8a1901203_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Zi Char",,Mini Chiffon Cakes,"Promo Code: 𝐟𝐚𝐭𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠𝟏𝟎%
Starting the weekend right with @mahotasg delicious range of 𝐌𝐢𝐧𝐢 𝐂𝐡𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐨𝐧 𝐂𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐬!
The 𝐂𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐜 𝐁𝐨𝐱 comprises of:
𝐃𝐚𝐫𝐤 𝐂𝐡𝐨𝐜𝐨𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐂𝐫𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐡
𝐘𝐮𝐳𝐮 𝐑𝐞𝐝 𝐕𝐞𝐥𝐯𝐞𝐭
𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡𝐚 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐦 𝐀𝐳𝐮𝐤𝐢
𝐆𝐨𝐦𝐚 𝐁𝐥𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐲
These mini chiffon cakes from @mahotasg are rich in flavor yet light and not too sweet. The soft, fluffy and moist chiffon cakes are coated with a thick layer of cream, with a delicate layer of mochi hidden beneath.
My favourites are tied between 𝐃𝐚𝐫𝐤 𝐂𝐡𝐨𝐜𝐨𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐂𝐫𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐡 and 𝐘𝐮𝐳𝐮 𝐑𝐞𝐝 𝐕𝐞𝐥𝐯𝐞𝐭. I am a big fan of chocolate hence I like the how rich 𝐃𝐚𝐫𝐤 𝐂𝐡𝐨𝐜𝐨𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐂𝐫𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐡 was and the added textural contrast from the crunch just elevates the indulgence experience. I find the 𝐘𝐮𝐳𝐮 𝐑𝐞𝐝 𝐕𝐞𝐥𝐯𝐞𝐭 very refreshing as the citrus flavor adds a twist to the usual red velvet.
Grab a box of these delightful cakes for your loved ones to cheer them up during this trying period! Quote to enjoy 10% off all cake purchases on @mahotasg web store!",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/3246d3384da9655f41e61900850_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Zi Char",,Chiffon Cake,"Delightful and delicious petite chiffons that not only impressed in looks but also in execution. These soft and fluffy cakes were topped with smooth and light flavoured cream. Loved the unexpected chewy textural contrast from the playful inclusion of mochi tucked within the cream.
Each classic box comes with 4 flavours that were enjoyable in their own right, leaving us divided among our favourite flavour:
𝐃𝐚𝐫𝐤 𝐂𝐡𝐨𝐜𝐨𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐂𝐫𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐡 - One for the chocolate lovers with its rich chocolate flavour and adornments of crunchy feuilletine.
𝐘𝐮𝐳𝐮 𝐑𝐞𝐝 𝐕𝐞𝐥𝐯𝐞𝐭 - Loved the refreshing citrus flavour from the yuzu cream but felt that the red velvet element was somewhat lost.
𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡𝐚 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐦 𝐀𝐳𝐮𝐤𝐢 - As ardent matcha fans, found the matcha to be on the lighter side. Appreciated the pairing with azuki and inclusion of actual red bean.
𝐆𝐨𝐦𝐚 𝐁𝐥𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐲 - Similarly, felt that the nutty black sesame flavour could have been stronger but an enjoyable goma chiffon nonetheless.
Overall, we appreciated how these were just the right sweetness level and light on the palette such that it was difficult to stop at just one. That said, don’t expect flavour bombs but more of a comforting treat. Some of us would have preferred for the base chiffons to be more intensely flavoured (as opposed to having the flavour only come from the cream), but others did enjoy the light but distinct flavour profiles.
Besides these chiffons, they also offer a whole range of cakes including keto options and more unique cakes in the box.

Zi Char",,Fishes From Tekong Farm!,"Sea bass in fried chye poh sauce ($9.90 special) 🐟 7/10
The way you order fish here is kind of confusing -- you have to write on a chit:
1️⃣ What kind of fish you want (which determines the dish's price)
2️⃣ Whether you want your fish steamed or fried, and
3️⃣ What sauce you want out of 6 sauces.
[yikes i think i've been writing too many emails]
When I ordered the 'fried chye poh sauce', I was expecting the 港式蒸鱼 (cantonese fish) style with added crispy radish on top. Yes the radish was crispy but the sauce was simple diluted soy sauce.

Deep fried sea bass in nyonya assam ($22) 🐟 7/10
Not a big fan of their assam here because everyone knows peranakan food is supposed to taste strong but this wasn't strong-flavoured enough. It was barely sour too.
I liked the crispiness of the fish -- judging by how long it took for them to cook the dish, it was definitely freshly fried. But I think it could have been crispier especially at the head and tail.",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/2f6103924cfdec7463681900329_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Zi Char",,Mahota Kitchen,"Visited Mahota Kitchen at Century Square a week ago and personally we were quite disappointed initially because the duck confit and the 9 element box which we initially wanted to order were sold out. However, after tasting the food that we have ordered, we concluded that the 30 minutes of waiting in the queue was worthwhile.
We have ordered the Slow Cooked Star Anise Rosemary pork belly with pumpkin and Sweet potato mash & Sauerkraut caramalized onion in pork wine sauce ($16), Capellini with Tiger Prawns, Cherry Tomato & Sweet Chye Poh in Aglio Olio Topped with Crispy Sweet Chye Poh ($15), and Sweet Potato Ricotta & Black Sesame Cake ($6).
Just like many other girls, initially we were worried that the pork belly will turn out to be oily/ greasy and we cannot imagine how much of calories we have to burn for that meal. However, to our surprise, the pork belly tasted really tender and juicy, and it was not that oily. Whereas, for the Capellini with Tiger Prawns, the chye poh taste blend in relatively well with the Capellini. The pasta was not overpowered with the chye poh taste and the prawns were all well done, it was tender and springly. Moreover, the Sweet Potato Ricotta & Black Sesame Cake was a great blend as well, something unique yet taste really nice.

ANL Makan,1 REVIEW,0 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$5/pax,"Hawker Food
Thai
Nasi Lemak",,Thai Red Curry Chicken Set,"Had been wanting to give ANL Makan and Colonel Wings a try ever since I had passed by them whilst being in Simei — the stall is conveniently located within the Kopitiam coffeeshop at Blk 248 Simei Street 3, and are concepts that are by the folks behind Dynasty Group that also operates brands such as Thai Dynasty, Golden Thai Village and Bowl & Grill (the latter two also operating a stall of their own in the same coffeeshop).
Between ANL Nasi Lemak and Colonel Wings, we found Colonel Wing’s offerings to be a little bit more outstanding than that of ANL Nasi Lemak’s in terms of execution. Opting for the Thai Red Curry Chicken Set from ANL Nasi Lemak, all sets here comes with the trendy Butterfly Pea Flower Coconut Rice, Thai Omelette, Mango Salad and Thai Sambal Chili. We were less impressed with the Butterfly Pea Flower Coconut Rice here especially; whilst carrying a beautiful hue of blue, the rice lacked coconut-y fragrance — instead being more akin to coloured plain rice though it was the Thai Red Curry Chicken that saved the dish being pretty well-portioned with long beans and chunks of diced chicken in a absolutely lemak Thai-style red curry. The Thai Omelette is nothing much to shout about as well — personally would have preferred something more artisanal like the Thai-style crispy omelette instead, though the Thai Sambal Chili didn’t disappoint with its savoury note and piquant punch of spiciness that tickles the tastebuds for those who can take moderate levels of spiciness.
Probably wouldn’t make the special trip down to Simei for ANL Nasi Lemak but Colonel Wings does seem like a pretty decent dining option in the neighbourhood — perhaps even good to pair with beer as a bar bite for those looking to just settle for an alcoholic session with fried food in the heartlands …",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/1c299c981cce0383ea21917625_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

For hygiene purposes, the 麻辣香锅 here is ordered via a paper checklist format whereby the staff will hand you an ingredients’ list and you will tick what you want in your stir fry, including the spiciness level. As we both prefer heavy-flavoured dishes, we will naturally gravitate towards the 中辣 level and oh-my-god, this is one spicy and numbing 麻辣香锅. When you see that they charge for the 香锅 base, you know that they are serious in their spices and here, you will get the full-on spicy experience. Besides the 麻辣香锅, they do have a separate menu of stir fry dishes of 东北 and 四川cuisine.

Hotplate Beancurd, $10
Hotplate Beancurd have always been our favourite and a must-order dish when we visit a tze char or similar shop. Sakura's version has prawns, chicken, tofu and eggs sitting on a starchy sauce. Together with the baby corn and carrots, it gave the dish some crunchiness amidst a sea of soft egg and tofu.
•
Tom Yum Seafood Soup, $10
Served bubbling in a claypot atop a burner was their Tom Yum Seafood Soup. There was an assortment of ingredients like prawns, fishballs and chicken in it. The soup was refreshing with its spicy and sour flavour, albeit too spicy for us. Best of all, it remained hot till our very last sip!

Japanese",,Tendon,"Brought mum to try Akimitsu’s tendon and she gave positive feedback for their tendon. She commented that it is not as oily/ greasy as she has expected and the tempura is rather tasty. Moreover, they have multigrain rice option for healthier choice. The tendon comes with a chawamushi. Gonna revisit the outlet at Changi City Point to try their other items in the menu since its just 5 minutes mrt ride from home, though personally Kohaku Tendon still remains as my top choice. 😊
Ps: Mum gave a rating of 3/5 stars. 📍 Akimitsu, Changi City Point

The White Peach Oolong Latte ($7.10, Large) sounds conceptually amazing, thought on the pricey side..... Except there apparently is one issue that is major to me (personal preference) - they apparently don't serve pearls? I never drink bubble tea without pearls. Lol.
Of course, I haven't validated this as this wasn't my own purchase. But if that were true... Perhaps I'd try this again if the tea itself was amazing?
But that too wasn't to my usual taste preferences. The taste of milk was overpowering compared to any taste of oolong. I prefer to taste a strong presence of tea in my drink, & I find that few bubble tea places deliver on this.
Appreciated the kind gift, but I don't think there's a strong push factor for me to return & try the rest of their drinks.",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/1656510987_review_image1943271_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Zi Char",,Celebrate Father’s Day this coming weekend with @goodyearseafood 🎉,"Located at an ulu industrial area in Tampines, @goodyearseafood has been operating for around 14 years, offering a variety of yummy zi char dishes, as well as Pontian style herbal Bak Kut Teh. Just like many other unfortunate F&B establishments, their business was badly affected during P2HA, due to its remote location. After tasting their food, we all agreed that it’s really a pity they aren’t getting as much attention as they deserve…
Featured are some of their popular dishes!
👉Assam Fish Head - SGD28
👉Garlic Steamed Sotong - SGD14
👉Golden Garlic Fried Pork - SGD15
👉Poached Chinese Spinach w Assorted Eggs - SGD15
👉Bak Kut Teh (S) - SGD6.80
👉Good Year Yang Zhou Fried Rice - SGD7
The MVP here was no doubt their Assam Fish Head. Comes with a generous serving of vegetables, the fragrant Assam curry was thick, well-balanced and nothing too overwhelming. I liked that it wasn’t too spicy, hence leaving a pleasantly sweet-sour aftertaste in my mouth. Most importantly, the fish head was fresh and meaty too!😋👍
Special mention goes out to their Signature Golden Garlic Fried Pork. I must admit this dish didn’t quite survive the delivery but after throwing them into the air fryer, miracles do happen!🤩
❗️FREE Bak Kut Teh (M) worth SGD12.80 for every SGD80 spent if you self collect
‼️PROMO 2 for SGD50 crabs (450g-500g each)
💌Thanks @goodyearseafood for arranging this lunch feast for my family and me. We enjoyed it very much!☺️

Getting to the restaurant is by no means an easy feat as it’s located at a quiet and industrial part of Tampines tail end with no buses or trains nearby. Additionally, the parking is quite challenging as there are no designated parking lots and you just slot in your vehicle safely to any empty space near the restaurant. However, that’s the whole charm about it as you can rarely find such a dining experience and environment in Singapore these days. On this very day, we had the bak kut teh; spare ribs that’s cooked in a slightly herby broth with a myriad of ingredients such as pork belly, beancurd sheets and enoki mushroom in it. The broth is able to carry the entire show as it’s so palatable that you will keep refilling it several times. When you’re there, do yourself a favour and order the preserved vegetables which I very much like the version here as the vegetables are chopped thicker and bigger so that you get more crunch and the pièce de résistance are the crispy pork lards that they added into it.

Zi Char",,For a Hole-in-the-Wall Family Meal,"This old-school joint is set in an industrial estate in Tampines, but that doesn't certainly doesn't deter the crowds (mostly families) who willingly make the trek down for its honest-to-goodness cooking and reasonable prices. This place is known for Johor-style Bak Kut Teh (from $5.50), characterised by its herbal soup base. However, like some Burpplers, you may be tempted to go for the Cabbage Whole Chicken ($16) instead. The weekend specialty sees a whole kampong chicken cooked in its own broth in a claypot lined with cabbage leaves. The soup is sweet, the chicken is tender and the melt-in-your-mouth cabbage pieces are divine. This alone is enough to pair with white rice, but if you're dining in a larger group, consider adding on the tasty Mongolian Pork Ribs ($10), Assam Fish ($22) or an unusual offering of German Style Pork Knuckle ($22), plus a vegetable dish of your choice.
Avg Price: $15 per person

As we were too full from the meal, we only ate the Banana pie about 2 hours later and unexpectedly, it was still slight crispy! The banana filling bursts into our mouths as we bite it too. We felt that it tastes similar to goreng pisang, just without the oiliness.

Set D - Beef Thai Boat Noodles- $15.90
·
Real Thai offers a spread of yummy al carte and set meals for Thai food lovers like me! Set D is Thai boat noodles, I picked the mixed beef flavour. It’s so flavourful I want to finish the whole bowl of soup! The slice beef and meatball is not stingy at all. The set also comes with deep fried chicken & soft drink. Top up $2 to change to coconut water. I like their Chicken Pad Thai ($9.80)! Their side dishes are great too such as the Chicken in Pandan ($6.80). Must end off the meal with some Thai dessert. Red Ruby ($4.50) has a slight crunch texture which is addictive. They also offer mango sticky rice with pandan flavour

,🍖At first glance, I was quite disappointed at how thinly sliced most of the char siew are. But when I bite into it, the charred flavour from the meat and sauce burst in my mouth! This is what a good plate of char siew should taste like. Eventhough the char siew is more to the lean side of the meat and for my plate, there's no fat at all. But the flavour wins it all.
It was a pleasant meal. I will be trying out their roast duck and roast pork next. I think they have a few outlets around Singapore too.",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/33f3b3f40507288e098c1927655_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Japanese",すき家,Melted Cheese Gyudon (M) | $7.50,"Yeah this sounds a bit weird right, but according to the menu, which claims that this was the number one topping in Japan, and is always served with a bottle of tabasco. I love tabasco, so why not give it a shot right. My first time at Sukiya, a Japanese guidon chain, I was surprised to find a plethora of options from curry rice bowls to miso salmon bowls as well. So whether you like beef, chicken, or are pescatarian, there would be something for you here. Another thing which amazed me was the relatively affordable pricing. If one opts for the simple option of the regular sized Gyudon, it would only cost them $4.50. With pretty efficient service (though not a big seating area), I do think it is pretty worth it!
The melted cheese gyudon did not strike me as extremely melty — I really was expecting more creaminess from it. However, after a bit of mixing, the combination of three cheeses was trumped by the mozzarella-stringy cheese like texture. Ultimately, I did not think that the cheese contributed much to the don except for a slight creaminess, but in terms of taste and flavour, it was lacking. Then again, the meat itself was not the most flavourful. It did come with a slight juiciness and sauce, but it did feel a bit lacklustre in taste.
With Sukiya’s affordable prices and decent quality of food, I see myself coming back so that I can try more of their items on their menu! The more enticing items will inevitably be more expensive, but hopefully Sukiya is able to deliver and match up in terms of quality.

Japanese",すき家,Iced Matcha Latte | $4.50,"When I opted for no sugar in this iced matcha latte, I was advised by the staff that if I do not add a bit of sugar, it would not be as nice. I was a bit speechless as I thought that matcha could still be amazing without sugar, so I went ahead with my personal preference. Lo and behold, the matcha latte was… really not nice at all. But I don’t think sugar will salvage it either. The matcha itself was rough and powdery in texture, and had no taste at all. With the supposed Hokkaido milk, all I could taste was milk and a bland tea taste, not so much the matcha essence. I do hope that in one way or another, the standard of the matcha latte improves, as with the rather affordable price point, it will surely be a hit if done well.

You could taste the freshness of the veggies, and the okonomiyaki also had a nicely charred based, while the insides were still fluffy.

I can have my hot steamed mantou in peace. It was unfortunate that the suntec outlet is permanently closed as I frequent getting their mantous whenever I am near the place.
I ordered the yam, purple sweet potato and banana chocolate. I want to eat the Yam mantou right now as it was my favourite flavour and opt for it in warm.
Really love the softness of the mantou which made this brand popular. The yam filling was not too sweet and decent amount when peel in half.
For the price of $2.40, it is worth investing my money and time to get this mantou whenever I am craving for it. Will be having the rest of the mantous for tomorrow breakfast and lunch 😋
Will be back to get their other flavour options which are the healthier ones ☺️

Several of the new stalls include GoPizza (@gopizza.sg), a Korean fusion pizzeria with unique combinations such as Bacon Potato Pizza and Korean Bulgogi Pizza and the popular 456 Mian Fen Guo (@456mianfenguo) from Bedok has opened their second outlet right here at Timbre+ Eastside. The dry version of the handmade and pulled mee hoon kway is just so good that we polished the entire bowl clean.
For authentic Indonesian cuisine, there is D’Penyetz (@dpenyetz_timbreplusexpo) to satisfy your savoury cravings with ayam penyet and ikan bakar before ending the meal with D’Cendol, a sweet and refreshing cendol dessert with kacang merah or durian. A fiery spicy option that will leave you sweating buckets will be Sedap Mala (@sedapmala2021) which specializes in the spicy numbing mala soup. The stall is in the midst of getting the halal certification and all of the ingredients right now are made without pork or lard. There is an opening promotion of $2.77/100g for all ingredients and you can choose to have them cooked in the signature mala (dry/soup), tangy tomato (soup) or fragrant garlic stir-fry.
Besides being a food park haven for foodies and alike, Timbre+ Eastside is also actively advocating sustainability and green movements such as having a Book Corner whereby it is a book swop space for diners to pick a book or two to read or donate their books for others.

Firstly, the waffle was dry and had a hard texture but the saddest part was both the gelato. The former had minimal walnut bits in it that you will not even notice it is there and it had a very weak banana flavour, almost just taste of a milk gelato instead of banana walnut. The Yubari Rock Melon just tasted sweet, very much lacking the rock melon aroma or flavour.

.
Updated Info(from Emi's)**
If you mix and match Premium & Supreme scoop, that will be a $1 offset which means to say; instead of $9.50 total, will become $8.50. Same logic apply to 2 Pre 1 Sup or vice versa.
That being say, Emi's said they had done some adjustment in the waffle recipe over the weekends. So do give them a try again if you ever there.
.
Despite many bad review about them, I still have a go on it and try cause taste and experience is personal and everyone deserve a second chance.
Place was super small and kind of hot & stuffy or maybe is just us that were too hot to handle.🥵
Knowing about how they count the price for premium and supreme scoop independently, we tend to be more caution about it.😅
We had a waffle($5) with triple supreme scoop($13).😙
Waffle crust was perfectly done to a nice crispy state but the inner part of the thick waffle was way undercooked, its like eating partially cooked flour mixture.🤢 Waffle tasted bland & gelato didn't help much either.😔
Luckily, their gelato was alright. All their Gelato carried a much more intense flavour, silkier texture and denser than normal ice cream.
Belgian Chocolate🍫 - Thick & dense chocolatey flavour.
Chrysanthemum with Wolfberry😋 - Wow! This is fantastic. Distinctive strong and floral taste with bits of wolfberry with a delicate smooth texture.
Mocha with Biscotti & Chip - Grainy texture due to the mixture of biscotti biscuit. Sweet. Coffee taste was moderate. Like eating a typical high tea set.
I hope they can give a little bigger scoop of Gelato in the future as it is smaller if compare to others but nonetheless, it still pretty worth the try.👌

The fees for that alone is absolutely daylight robbery and almost costs as much as my food. Moving onto the next option in the list is the trusty Hong Kong Street chain of zichar stalls, which are priced affordably and tastes yummy too.

I had another stir fry cabbage, sadly, i did found a hair in it(dont know if it really an armpit hair?)

Just a short walk away from Tampines MRT station, FPC seafood is a cozy eatery with a friendly lady boss who always greets me with a big smile! Each dish is made with loads of love and sincerity by the male chef boss!
Their fried chicken strips and pineapple slices are a match made in heaven! Although they are fried, the chicken strips are not greasy at all! Check the lettuce leaf underneath the chicken - no oil stain! Don’t forget to dip the chicken in the home-made plum sauce! Yum yum!! Their fried chicken in salted egg sauce is also another favourite of mine!
You know you have chanced upon a great eatery when they serve you 排骨王 (sweet sour pork chop) that’s tender with perfectly caramelised sauce!
Oh don’t forget to order their hor fun! Do a
takeaway if possible as it tastes even better after the hor fun has taken a soak in the sauce! My parents said the hor fun reminded them of the delicious hor fun they had when they were young!

Delivery",,Basil Leaf Chicken With Rice ($5),"A relatively new stall selling various Thai rice/noodle and side dishes in the Hola Cafeteria next to Simei MRT station.
One of the most popular dishes is none other than this Basil leaf chicken with rice. The basil leaves made the dish incredibly fragrant and sort of became another aromatic leafy vegetable (instead of the limp basil leaves commonly found in this dish served elsewhere) to be savoured, aside from the diced long beans. The minced chicken was tender in a sauce packed with a spicy kick and so much of flavour. Adding a sunny side up ($0.50) is a must as the glorious flowy yolk could make the whole dish come together even more. Definitely my place to go before my night shifts😊

Delivery",,Vegetarian - A tough theme for this week's #feedthetheme for Jae since she almost do not eat any kind of vegetables.,"We had this Vegetarian mix rice ($4.50) and ironically chose ""meats"". For the meat on the left, we could relate it to Otah with its black pepper marinate and texture. The meat on the right is something similar to Sweet and Sour Pork which also taste okay. Their Curry Chicken and Potatoes tastes like legit Curry Chicken too! Kae says that he will be back for more while Jae prefers having her Vegetarian Beehoon with Char Siew.

Delivery",,Ah Balling Tang Yuan (SGD $3.20) @ Ji De Chi.,"This franchise is better known for their towering snow ice desserts, but they also serve traditional desserts.
.
They have the largest glutinous rice balls I've seen, either that or it's an optical illusion brought about from the small bowl. With a soft chewy sticky texture, and pink or white hues to indicate the type of filling within.
.
The black sesame paste has an earthy sweet nutty taste with a coarse creamy texture, while the peanut paste has a nutty sweet flavour with a fine chunky texture.
.
Love the warm ginger soup with its herbal sweet spice flavour, so comforting. Heed their reminder to eat desserts!.

Delivery",,Durian Snow Ice,"This is one of our favourite ice shavings for a sweet treat - the durian snow ice at Ji De Chi! For only $7.90, you get a towering block of durian-flavoured ice shaving, which does not taste very artificial (unlike Mac's durian mcflurry) and really has the taste of durian imbued! This is coupled with a scoop of real durian puree at the side which makes the dish really worth it!
One minor point is that you are unable to choose your toppings, and for the durian snow ice, you only have the option to go with the QQ balls for your dessert! Not too bad, but we would prefer to have a choice though!",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/2f33ba11b8dca5d4059e1914585_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Delivery",,Mango/Glutinous Rice Roll | $6.60,"Filled with mango compote and black glutinous rice, this rice roll was interesting, but not impressive. The flavours did not really blend well together - an combination of overly sweet mango cubes and a rather bland (and stingy amount of) glutinous rice. Both ingredients were not spread out evenly in this rice roll either. Further, the rice roll itself was a tad thick, which made it difficult to chew and swallow without overwhelming the mango/glutinous flavours.

The sorbet had a good soft and creamy texture to it - yet still retaining its slight icy-ness unlike an ice cream. Mango cubes, sago, and nata de coco went well with the overall flavour. A good alternative for those looking for something that’s not their snowy ice and a dessert slightly smaller!

The only gripe I have with this series is that we are unable to choose our toppings :( honestly, I don’t know if the topping changes everyday with every snow ice or if it’s fixed, but for this bowl, there were quite a number of toppings which I’d rather not have in my snow ice! I personally think kidney beans and Chin chow with snow ice... a bit weird!?

Delivery",,Durian Snowy Ice | $7.90,"This was a super good after meal dessert! First off, while you do not expect Mao Shan Wang standard durian, the durian taste in the snow ice was strong enough to my liking, and the durian purée at the side tops it off to give you an even stronger durian taste. Plus, the purée was creamy, giving it a good blend together with the icy texture of the snow ice. The other toppings alongside included sagos of different sizes - nothing special but I guess it just provides an additional chewiness to the dessert. For this price, I think the portion is really huge, meant for sharing! However, the stall does seem understaffed especially for its popularity and during the peak hour, and waiting time for both seats and food might be a little Long. But if you’re not in a rush, I’m sure it’ll be worth the wait.

The former had minimal walnut bits in it that you will not even notice it is there and it had a very weak banana flavour, almost just taste of a milk gelato instead of banana walnut. The Yubari Rock Melon just tasted sweet, very much lacking the rock melon aroma or flavour.

Mont Blanc is very lackluster. Cinnamon chocolate fudge can obviously taste the cinnamon but not the chocolate. Waffle is crisp but plain. Maple syrup is sweet. Waffle with ice cream is meh.",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/32e3b2c2c379fb4f54961883854_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

.
Updated Info(from Emi's)**
If you mix and match Premium & Supreme scoop, that will be a $1 offset which means to say; instead of $9.50 total, will become $8.50. Same logic apply to 2 Pre 1 Sup or vice versa.
That being say, Emi's said they had done some adjustment in the waffle recipe over the weekends. So do give them a try again if you ever there.
.
Despite many bad review about them, I still have a go on it and try cause taste and experience is personal and everyone deserve a second chance.
Place was super small and kind of hot & stuffy or maybe is just us that were too hot to handle.🥵
Knowing about how they count the price for premium and supreme scoop independently, we tend to be more caution about it.😅
We had a waffle($5) with triple supreme scoop($13).😙
Waffle crust was perfectly done to a nice crispy state but the inner part of the thick waffle was way undercooked, its like eating partially cooked flour mixture.🤢 Waffle tasted bland & gelato didn't help much either.😔
Luckily, their gelato was alright. All their Gelato carried a much more intense flavour, silkier texture and denser than normal ice cream.
Belgian Chocolate🍫 - Thick & dense chocolatey flavour.
Chrysanthemum with Wolfberry😋 - Wow! This is fantastic. Distinctive strong and floral taste with bits of wolfberry with a delicate smooth texture.
Mocha with Biscotti & Chip - Grainy texture due to the mixture of biscotti biscuit. Sweet. Coffee taste was moderate. Like eating a typical high tea set.
I hope they can give a little bigger scoop of Gelato in the future as it is smaller if compare to others but nonetheless, it still pretty worth the try.👌

Their fried chicken strips and pineapple slices are a match made in heaven! Although they are fried, the chicken strips are not greasy at all! Check the lettuce leaf underneath the chicken - no oil stain! Don’t forget to dip the chicken in the home-made plum sauce! Yum yum!! Their fried chicken in salted egg sauce is also another favourite of mine!
You know you have chanced upon a great eatery when they serve you 排骨王 (sweet sour pork chop) that’s tender with perfectly caramelised sauce!

Delivery",,Basil Leaf Chicken With Rice ($5),"A relatively new stall selling various Thai rice/noodle and side dishes in the Hola Cafeteria next to Simei MRT station.
One of the most popular dishes is none other than this Basil leaf chicken with rice. The basil leaves made the dish incredibly fragrant and sort of became another aromatic leafy vegetable (instead of the limp basil leaves commonly found in this dish served elsewhere) to be savoured, aside from the diced long beans. The minced chicken was tender in a sauce packed with a spicy kick and so much of flavour. Adding a sunny side up ($0.50) is a must as the glorious flowy yolk could make the whole dish come together even more. Definitely my place to go before my night shifts😊

First thing, the serving was nice and i think it is already good for 2-3 person. The smell was pleasantly good.

Delivery",,Ah Balling Tang Yuan (SGD $3.20) @ Ji De Chi.,"This franchise is better known for their towering snow ice desserts, but they also serve traditional desserts.
.
They have the largest glutinous rice balls I've seen, either that or it's an optical illusion brought about from the small bowl. With a soft chewy sticky texture, and pink or white hues to indicate the type of filling within.
.
The black sesame paste has an earthy sweet nutty taste with a coarse creamy texture, while the peanut paste has a nutty sweet flavour with a fine chunky texture.
.
Love the warm ginger soup with its herbal sweet spice flavour, so comforting. Heed their reminder to eat desserts!.

Delivery",,Durian Snow Ice,"This is one of our favourite ice shavings for a sweet treat - the durian snow ice at Ji De Chi! For only $7.90, you get a towering block of durian-flavoured ice shaving, which does not taste very artificial (unlike Mac's durian mcflurry) and really has the taste of durian imbued! This is coupled with a scoop of real durian puree at the side which makes the dish really worth it!
One minor point is that you are unable to choose your toppings, and for the durian snow ice, you only have the option to go with the QQ balls for your dessert! Not too bad, but we would prefer to have a choice though!",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/2f33ba11b8dca5d4059e1914585_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Delivery",,Mango/Glutinous Rice Roll | $6.60,"Filled with mango compote and black glutinous rice, this rice roll was interesting, but not impressive. The flavours did not really blend well together - an combination of overly sweet mango cubes and a rather bland (and stingy amount of) glutinous rice. Both ingredients were not spread out evenly in this rice roll either. Further, the rice roll itself was a tad thick, which made it difficult to chew and swallow without overwhelming the mango/glutinous flavours.

The sorbet had a good soft and creamy texture to it - yet still retaining its slight icy-ness unlike an ice cream. Mango cubes, sago, and nata de coco went well with the overall flavour. A good alternative for those looking for something that’s not their snowy ice and a dessert slightly smaller!

The only gripe I have with this series is that we are unable to choose our toppings :( honestly, I don’t know if the topping changes everyday with every snow ice or if it’s fixed, but for this bowl, there were quite a number of toppings which I’d rather not have in my snow ice! I personally think kidney beans and Chin chow with snow ice... a bit weird!?

Delivery",,Durian Snowy Ice | $7.90,"This was a super good after meal dessert! First off, while you do not expect Mao Shan Wang standard durian, the durian taste in the snow ice was strong enough to my liking, and the durian purée at the side tops it off to give you an even stronger durian taste. Plus, the purée was creamy, giving it a good blend together with the icy texture of the snow ice. The other toppings alongside included sagos of different sizes - nothing special but I guess it just provides an additional chewiness to the dessert. For this price, I think the portion is really huge, meant for sharing! However, the stall does seem understaffed especially for its popularity and during the peak hour, and waiting time for both seats and food might be a little Long. But if you’re not in a rush, I’m sure it’ll be worth the wait.

Multiple award winning Cantonese chef Tan Yong Hua divulges he coaxed the recipe out of a famous Peking Duck chef during a business trip to China.
To eat, dust each piece in palm sugar, then wrap in a sauce filled pancake with cucumber and leek. The sauce is particularly mellifluous, having been made from a secret blend of four herbs that have been steamed for eight hours.
Only the first course, and the bar is already set high for what is to follow.

Instead of a usual steamed fish, the green wrasse was baked in claypot and the amazing part is how much effort is put in to making each dish perfect as Chef Tan listens to tell if it's ready for serving as the conditions for cooking varies. Talk about experience!
Sauce is then poured on the fish instead of being cooked together so one can still get the natural sweetness of that tender, succulent flesh. Definitely will be back for this.

Refer to our website or Facebook for more info and menu",Every good chef is an even greater storyteller and Chef Tan Yong Hua is no exception.,"This chapter of Chef Tan's story revolves around foods that he grew up eating and dishes that he has perfected using unique ingredients marrying with traditional cooking techniques to cater to the modern tastebuds.
•
You might have read the Chicken Soup for the Soul series in your adolescent years or even now, but this is truly a comforting bowl of chicken soup for the soul. Using ingredients such as boiled Japan jyounsai, honshimeiji and wolfberries to enhance the flavour and texture, the chicken consommé with chicken fillet brings about a warmth feeling at every sip, just like a hot bowl of soup waiting for you to savour when at home.

I am so wowed by this. Pumpkin soup with japanese mirin and lobster meat served in mini pumpkin cup. Tiny bits of lobster meat with mini chunks of crunchy vegs. 🔼
Soup looked simple but the taste was deliciously intense. This is a serving for one pax. Cost at $12 but so worth it. 🔼
Unfortunately, did not get to talk to Chef Tan as would have loved hearing his food journey stories. But I enjoyed the food so much that I have decided to come back to try the other items real soon. Recommended to try.

Refer to our website or Facebook for more info and menu",This is rosella flower jelly.,"A heavy tinge of herbal but if you like herbal, this is quite manageable. 🔼
Served cold with alittle syrup, balanced off by bits of mango. Good to know : each 100g sheath of rosella flowers contain 260mg vitamin C, 3x stronger than black wine, 9x stronger than citrus orange and 10x more than starfruit. 🔼
So this is a powerful healthy dessert. Cost at $5 per bowl. It is actually quite refreshing after a heavy meal.

Refer to our website or Facebook for more info and menu",Showcasing my all time favorite peking duck.,"This is part of my half duck meant to be eaten on its own or with the chinese crepe. Of course the crispy skin which was wrapped with scallions and cucumber (with sweet sauce or sugar) in the chinese crepe was gone in seconds.
🔼
Wonderfully golden brown and glistening skin. Duck is roasted over lychee wood. Very tasty. However, it has to be eaten with the sweet sauce as it was just a teeny weeny dry.
🔼
Duck so thinly sliced shows insanely good knife skills. Overall a yummy dish.

So this was the plating for my braised pork knuckle noodles. Braised for hours, meat was super tender. You can literally taste all the herbs, spices and the porky flavor all at one go. The noodles., I presume, was thrown in and braised together with the porky gravy till it soaks up all the juices. Noodles surprising was not soggy...it was alittle aldente.

Halal","With Bara, grilling takes centre stage in Indonesian cuisine - drawing out the rich aroma and flavors of our rice. Introducing the Indonesian Nasi Bakar; rich, aromatic, spice-infused rice wrapped in banana leaves and grilled over to perfection serv...",Set E — Sate Lilit,"Bara has always been one of the places that we have wanted to make a visit to, though also one of those places that we just seemingly keep pushing back our plans on. Best known for their Nasi Bakar, the establishment which used to operate just a single location at Icon Village had recently expanded their operations with the opening of their newest outlet at Eastpoint Mall — just a stone’s throw away from Simei MRT Station. The new outlet is not only just bigger than their very first space ar Icon Village, but does seem to serve a wider selection of food as well. Their Eastpoint Mall outlet now features a dine-in area that is more spacious; the interior being decked with a traditional touch that is rather similar to the setting at their Icon Village space. Whilst the menu at Eastpoint Mall features pretty much the same Bara Set, ala-carte dishes and side dishes that are already served at their Icon Village location, the physical menus at Eastpoint Mall do not reflect the availability of desserts that are listed on the online menu of the same. Prices have been kept pretty reasonable — the Bara Sets, which consist of their signature Nasi Bakar, the patron’s choice of meat, Melinjo crackers, fried tofu and tempeh costs between $12.50 to $16.50, depending on the set ordered.
Skimming through the menu, we found ourselves being pretty drawn towards Set E from the Bara Set — the set featuring Sate Lilit (i.e. Balinese Chicken & Prawns
Satay) and also coming with Sambal Matah (i.e. Balinese Raw Sambal). The Nasi Bakar (i.e. Grilled Rice) comes wrapped in banana leaves — digging into the rice after unwrapping the banana leaves, we found the Nasi Bakar here to be pretty fragrant; the Nasi Bakar carried a flavour that was almost akin to that of our Hainanese Chicken Rice with rather prominent hints of garlic, while the rice also came lightly smoky. The grains were also suitably moist, with each grain being distinguishable from each other — all loosely packed within the banana leaves that it was packed in. The Sate Lilit sees the chicken and prawn paste being wrapped around stalks of lemongrass and then grilled — the consistency of the Sate Lilit suggested that there could be a higher proportion of chicken used over prawn; the texture was particularly meaty, while the satay does seem to be glazed with Kecap Manis for that slight sweetness it carries. The Sambal Matah wasn’t particularly spicy, but we felt that the medley of herbs and spices that it comes with provided a refreshing flavour profile that could be well eaten on its own or with the Nasi Bakar. Other elements such as the Fried Tofu and Fried Tempeh do come pretty appealing as well – the batter being sufficiently crisp and the texture of the batter almost similar to that of well-made chicken nuggets; the Belinjo Crackers also being crisp whilst carrying its distinctive note of bitterness and works well with the Sambals that the dish came with.
Having only tried the Set E — Sate Lilit and the Set C — Ayam Bakar Bara from the Bara Set menu at Bara, we could understand why they are such a well-loved brand by folks whom have visited their Icon Village outlet. They do seem to be able to provide a taste of Indonesian fare that is big on flavours and execution — whilst we have not much exposure to the Indonesian fare to comment on its authenticity, we did like what Bara has to offer; the flavoured rice being nothing short of being fragrant, while the meats are actually nicely executed. Coupled with its reasonable price point, Bara really is an appealing option to go for even sth in the heartlands to solve those cravings for Indonesian fare that is relatable to the masses. It is without a doubt that we would consider dining at their Icon Village outlet for lunch on days that a trip back to the office is needed — their food is something which might probably develop a craving for. That being said, those living in the East whom have yet to check them out can possibly consider giving their Eastpoint Mall outlet a go — a more convenient location with bigger premises that makes visiting them just a little easier than before!",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/1666408857_review_image1953474_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

I particularly liked the moreish pork meatballs that tasted more of pork than filler as is so often the case. Of course, I must mention the utterly addictive crispy fish strips that add an extra dimension of crunch and umami. Even the clear broth is delicious - mildly porky, sweet and with no trace of MSG.

Finally, don't forget to take a saucer of their tangy chicken rice-style chilli sauce, it really adds a load of punchy flavour to everything it graces.

This is one of the rare instances where I struggle to take a photo - cos the noodles & soup are equally as amazing. Which one should be in focus?
Firstly - ingredients are plentiful in variety & quantity. You've got the standard pork slices, minced pork, liver (cooked properly & not powdery); coupled with unique additions like scallop, dumpling, prawn paste meat, & clams. Perfect for a meaty seafood lover like me.
The mee pok noodles are thick & cooked al dente; slightly oily but still acceptable.. & the chilli gives you a good kick in every bite, without numbing your mouth.
The soup itself is delightful - light, yet flavourful. I appreciate that there's lots of shredded cabbage inside, so you get your greens/fibre in. It's a generous portion of soup too - big bowl! I savoured every bit of it, thankful that there was enough soup to go with every spoonful of noodle.

Tian Mi Mi 甜咪咪,1 REVIEW,0 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$5/pax,"Desserts
Hawker Food",,Taro Delight Bowl,"There seems to be quite a fair bit of change amongst the coffeeshops in the neighbourhood around Tampines Street 81 recently; some of the the coffeeshops had been through a renovation in the past one year, while there are also some changes in the ownership and management in other coffeeshops within the vicinity. One such coffeeshop which had been through a change of management in recent times would be BK Eating House at Blk 824 Tampines Street 81; the change of management in the coffeeshop also meant that there are new stalls operating within the coffeeshop as well — this includes stalls of the likes of an outlet of Gimee Face 给面子, as well as the second outlet of Koh Brother Pig's Organ Soup that originated from Tiong Bahru Food Centre. One of the stalls situated within BK Eating House that is new to the F&B scene would be Tian Mi Mi 甜咪咪; a new dessert stall that operates from a small kiosk space at the entrance to the coffeeshop. Being a stall that focuses on its dessert offerings, Tian Mi Mi serves up hot and cold desserts with a heavier emphasis on their cold dessert offerings (the hot desserts were also unavailable during our visit; they are to be launched at a later date). Their cold desserts are split across four different categories; there is an entire category that is dedicated to Taiwanese-style shaved ice featuring a variety of different flavours — think items like the Chendol Ice Bowl, Youtiao Chocolate Bowl, and the Golden MSW Bowl, just to name a few. Apart from Taiwanese-style shaved ice, there are also offerings split into Bean Curd, Grass Jelly and Aiyu (i.e. Ice Jelly) categories in its menu as well.
Skimming through the multiple items which Tian Mi Mi has to offer, it was the Taro Delight Bowl that really caught our attention amidst the various items that they had to offer. It is not being described on the menu on what are the elements which are featured in the Taro Delight Bowl, though the Taro Delight Bowl is an item that is being listed on the cold desserts section being parked under the Bean Curd category. The desserts at Tian Mi Mi do take some time to be made; patrons will be issued with an electronic buzzer once order and payment has been made at the counter — the patrons would then be paged to collect their food at the counter when they are ready. On first look, the Taro Delight Bowl feature elements such as that of Bean Curd, Taro Paste, Brown Sugar, Taro Balls, Ah Balling, and Red Rubies. Digging into the Taro Delights Bowl, it is noted that the Bean Curd is especially silken and slippery smooth — there is a slight hint of bean-y flavour that one would be able to detect in here. The bean curd is sufficiently sweetened from the brown sugar syrup that has been drizzled onto the bowl; the brown sugar syrup adding a deep earthiness amidst the sweetness and pairs well with all the elements within the bowl. While the dollop of yam paste added was slightly on the sweeter side of things for some, we did feel that the sweetness does come rather acceptable for sweet tooths in general; the yam paste is smooth without being particularly dense, whilst carrying and evident hint of earthiness that adds on to the various of dimensions here in the dessert as well. Elements like the Ah Balling and the Taro Balls helped to add a bit of chewiness to the entire bowl — one thing we especially loved about these were how they did not come too dense and thus not too overwhelming. The Red Rubies were an interesting addition; whilst we didn’t find these a necessary addition due to the Red Rubies adding a flavour of its own, these do provide a good crunch that further adds on to the bowl in terms of texture as well.
It is needless to say that we found ourselves enjoying the Taro Delight Bowl during our visit to Tian Mi Mi — taro paste served with bean curd isn’t a particularly an easy find around, and it seems like Tian Mi Mi has struck a chord with us on their variant of the Taro Delight Bowl. The bowl came with a good variety of elements that adds on to the entire dessert in terms of both flavours and textures, yet achieving a largely balanced level of sweetness across all levels. Apart from the Taro Delight Bowl, we had also given their Chendol Ice Bowl a try as well; while our favourite item between the two would be the Taro Delight Bowl, it is worth noting that it seems that the chendol jelly featured in the Chendol Ice Bowl does seem to be made from scratch — the chendol jelly coming in a pale green hue as opposed to the generic fluorescent green ones that some neighbourhood local shaved ice dessert stalls would serve with their Chendol. The quality of the Gula Melaka used in the Chendol Ice Bowl was also worth commending — one that was rich, thick and came with an earthy sweetness, though we did wish that they were a little bit more generous with the Gula Melaka here so that there is enough to go around the entire bowl. They were also especially generous with the portion of Attap seeds that were served with the Chendol Ice Bowl — our bowl came with a portion of four Attap seeds which is considered many especially when compared with similar shaved iced desserts that one would get from a local shaved iced dessert stall. Prices at Tian Mi Mi are also rather reasonable — the desserts being priced between $3.80 to $4.30 for the cold desserts listed under the Bean Curd, Grass Jelly and Aiyu categories, while the Taiwanese-style shaved ice offerings ranges from $5.90 to $7.90. Overall, Tian Mi Mi does serve up some really satisfying cold desserts; the Bean Curd category being probably their strongest suit with the Taro Delight Bowl being the one to-die-for — definitely a spot which we are looking forward to returning to!",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/1685895295_review_image1969916_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

So happy to finally find an affordable bingsu place as I never understood how it is possible to charge more than $15 for a bowl of shaved ice. This shop is located within a coffee shop at the HDB void deck and we missed it totally and had to walk backwards before we found it (also a bit blind on our part cuz it's actually just next to the drink stall and is actually quite prominent).
Mango madness is of course mango flavour and tastes good. Halo halo is supposed to be milk flavour but we didn't taste much of it in the shaved ice. However it's topped with coco crunch and bite size biscuits and some chocolate drizzle which makes the whole thing tastes good too.
Definitely will be back to try other flavours, even without the 1 for 1.",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/2fd5dfebbbea846d51661919764_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Bak Chang is no longer a festive food these days though many more people tend to eat it on the rice dumpling/ dragon boat festival (which falls on the 5th day of the 5th month of the lunar calendar).
Nonya chang (娘惹粽) is a version created by the Peranakan community. A Nonya-style bak chang is a sweet and savoury type of bak chang (a tad more sweet than salty, but not overly so) and it is my preferred choice of bak chang as well.
And when it comes to Nonya chang, Kim Choo Kueh Chang comes to mind as they are most well-known for their Nonya rice dumplings.
Their sticky rice is fragrant, tasty and well-cooked; soft with grains that are almost indistinguishable, but not mushy. They diced up the lean pork (filling) for better texture and I prefer this to minced up pork filling. I really like the sweetness level in their Nyonya rice dumplings from the candied winter melon added and the wonderful flavour from the Chinese five spice powder that is used to flavour the fillings.
I used to think that all glutinous rice taste the same until I tried the ones from Daun Rice Dumplings. 🤦🏻‍♀️🙅🏻‍♀️
And btw, Kim Choo Traditional Rice Dumplings is not the same (company) as Kim Choo Kueh Chang!
Kim Choo Kueh Chang's Nonya chang is absolutely delicious!",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/2f1246125a9d522de63a1642945_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Western",,Boston lobster kebabs harissa served with roasted vegetables and potato skewers.,"Delectably smoky lobster chunks, but the star of the show was certainly the very deviant and devilish sambal chilli smeared across the plate, which tasted like the sambal from the Boston lobster bakar (also available on the menu) undergone a midriff-baring, havoc clubbing/smoking phase after meeting the wrong happening crowd. So hot, yet you can’t stop, and you won’t stop.

Cakes",,Not Just An Aesthetic Gimmick,"The Rainbow Cheesecake can be one of the biggest gimmicks there is in desserts with which I tend to avoid; a pretty outlook with an underwhelming personality. Therefore I say this with great confidence, that I was really taken aback when I tasted the one supplied at MØ Cafe, because it turned out to be rather enjoyable. 🤤
While I was expecting this to taste similar to New York cheese cake (AKA my least favourite cake...), it did not feel heavy in texture with the cream cheese tasting quite light and not instantly overwhelming. That said, I cannot rule out the possibility of jelat-ness should you decide to have this on your own. Don't expect the colours to have their own individual flavour profiles as well, just in case you're really curious. 😂
It is always so darn satisfying to enjoy aesthetically pleasing dishes for their taste; after all, that's what food should always be about first...but finally, a rainbow cake that actually tastes as good as it looks, and I'm so glad to have discovered it at MO Cafe situated at COURTS Megastore, L2! 📣 @medanocoffee for the uber warm hosting and @foodie_quest for the invite!",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/43b9e163e8c33ab003a1611103_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Cakes",,Coffee Made With A Whole Lotta Heart,"Found at the dining/coffee tables area by the windows, the cafe is nearly camouflaged into the space (that, however, is intentional) of COURTS Megastore, MØ specialises in their own blend of coffees and have cakes and sweet/savoury pies with which the team samples thoroughly before bringing them in from suppliers, so you are guaranteed quality when you indulge on these pastries!
Exclusively at MØ Cafe, you have to try the MØlacca ($5.90, iced +$1) which uses the store's very own, and strictly only Mandheling coffee. The coffee smells fragrant and has a hint of gula melaka to it, which is partly a reason for the name. Served in a signature yellow cup, I really like this, and I speak as a person who is not a fan of coffee, because it has a robust flavour but is not bitter like most coffees I have tried. Definitely a must-try; you're missing out if you pay them a visit without giving this a go!
Swiping forward for dessert, the Sea Salt Caramel ($7.20) is probably one of the more memorable cakes here. It has an extremely prominent flavour and resembles closely to butterscotch. The cake leans towards a much sweeter taste so if you aren't a sweet tooth, sharing is highly recommended!
Having only opened for about 2 months, I'm really excited to see MØ Cafe grow and expand in due time. Regardless of what they decide to introduce in future, I hope they will always keep up the diligence they have in serving up quality F&B.
A big thank you to the team and staff behind @medanocoffee for being so incredibly warm and welcoming to host us! Shoutout also to @foodie_quest for having me at the tasting! 😁",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/43b9e1633660708d4a61608310_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Mr. Wong Seremban Beef Noodles,15 REVIEWS,27 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$5/pax,Hawker Food,,Beef Noodles (SGD $8) @ Mr Wong Seremban Beef Noodle.,"For well over a decade, Mr. Wong has been serving uniquely delicious bowls of beef noodles, derived from a perculiar Malaysian style.
.
The thick unctious gravy has robust meaty sweet savoury herbal flavour, the difference being its distinct sweetness from a sweet black sauce, carrots, and daikon radish, all added to the beef stock.
.
The garnish of crunchy roasted peanuts, juicy pickled mustard greens, and white sesame seeds, lend a unique nutty vegetal sweet sour salty flavour, lifting the overall dish.
.
The sliced beef is mildly tender with a light chew, the tripe is spongy with a slight crunch, while the beef meat balls have a satisfying bouncy texture, all with meaty savoury sweet flavour.
.
The silky thick bee hoon / rice vermicelli noodles complete this excellent bowl. Craving for more.

Mr. Wong Seremban Beef Noodles,15 REVIEWS,27 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$5/pax,Hawker Food,,"Formerly from Marina Parade Central Market & Food Centre, this was truly a lost and found situation as Mr. Wong Seremban Beef Noodles has relocated to Tampines.","Housed within a newly renovated coffeeshop along Tampines Street 91, the stall is very popular with the nearby residents as there was a long queue for it even though it just opened days ago. Got for myself the Sliced Beef Noodles (Dry) for $5.50 and it came with a choice of noodle such as the de facto thick bee hoon or thin bee hoon. The sliced beef was quickly blanched upon order and then added into the noodles with a thick gravy covering it before the finishing touches of preserved vegetables, peanuts and sesame seeds and spring onion were added to it. As I ordered the dry version, a bowl of soup was given but it was slightly underwhelming as the soup was watered down, without much of a flavour. However, the star of the show was definitely the brown gravy which had so much depth in flavours and it coated the noodles so well that every slurp was an enjoyment.

one77° (Timbre+ Eastside),2 REVIEWS,5 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$20/pax,"Cafes & Coffee
Western",,West Coast Barramundi with Assam Curry Rice,"Checked out the new One77 Degrees bistro located at Singapore Expo recently; a location that is a little far flung away from the crowds considering how it is situated at the far east, whilst also being located deep within the complex outside Hall 3 of MAX Atria. Offering a set menu, all set meals comes with a choice of starters, mains and drinks — all of that under $20; pretty affordable.
This item features elements such as pan-fried, locally farmed Barramundi, curry leaf-infused pilaf rice, cherry tomatoes, Okra, and eggplant with a tangy and spicy Tamarind (Assam) sauce served at the side. Intended to be enjoyed by pouring in the Tamarind sauce into all the other elements, we were pretty surprised by how the Tamarind sauce carried a punchy flavour that is tangy and refreshing, yet aptly spicy — suitable for those who are able to tolerant moderate levels of spiciness for how it provides a distinct, but not too fiery kick to tickle the taste buds. The pan-fried Barramundi was also pretty impressive; crisp on the exterior, the fish was sufficiently moist within, further enhanced by the Tamarind sauce poured into it. The buttery pilaf rice soaks up all of that sauce, allowing one to mop up all that delicious sauce altogether. Coming with a mix of greens such as eggplant, Okra and cherry tomatoes, the vegetables provide a crunch and a refreshing burst of zestiness that helps to provide more texture and flavour to dish for some balance. Overall, something which felt like it was put together with thought — almost akin to a local fusion variant of an Ochazuke that works; great execution and of a good quality for its price, and somewhere I would be glad to revisit if in the area (because it just takes quite a bit of effort for me to end up here; if only it was nearer to me though).",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/1c299c769d50d7877c01812647_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

PK Prawn Noodles,1 REVIEW,3 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$5/pax,"Hawker Food
Cheap & Good",,"Available At ""PK Prawn Noodles"" Only Until Early June 2017: ""Yuan Yang"" ($5)","The good news: I found a stall selling exceptionally tasty Penang-style ""hae mee"" (prawn noodles) and an interesting dish called ""Yuan Yang"" (pictured above) which is a half-and-half mix of ""hae mee"" and ""lor mee"" 😋😋.
The bad news: the hawker will be ceasing operations in early June 2017 😩😩.
So why am I planning to return for more of PK's food before he closes his stall? Well, it's because this Penang-ite uses a recipe handed down from his grandmother and does it real justice. Which shouldn't be surprising as he's been cooking ""hae mee"" since he was 12.
From chatting with him, I learned as well how much time and effort is required to create his dishes. The use of exact ingredients is also integral to achieving that authentic taste, especially for the stock. Which is why he even bothers to import ""ang kah hae"" (red-legged prawns) from Malaysia.
However, PK's pursuit of perfection is a double-edged sword because the difficulty he's encountered in obtaining the right ingredients is also the reason he is closing his stall despite only opening last November. Sigh...
All I can say is, if you want to give his noodles a try, do make a trip down soon. And if you can handle spiciness, his homemade ""sambal belachan"" is a must-have.",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/23ca4d4ac1398ceb7a81514989_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

My order, mee kia with Bee hoon soup $4 version. The first time I order the combo a few years back, the owner gave a menacing look and ask me.. Sure bo? Nowadays, he just sneer at me😜😜😜.
.
The noodle is springy and al-dente, while the bee hoon soaks up the sweet and robust pork bones soup.
.
The pork balls are bouncy, but watch out for flavour burst inside the wanton. Yum Yum.

Colonel Wings (Simei),1 REVIEW,0 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$10/pax,"Fried Chicken
Hawker Food",,3 pieces Wingettes and 3 pieces Drumlets (Tom Yum),"Had been wanting to give ANL Makan and Colonel Wings a try ever since I had passed by them whilst being in Simei — the stall is conveniently located within the Kopitiam coffeeshop at Blk 248 Simei Street 3, and are concepts that are by the folks behind Dynasty Group that also operates brands such as Thai Dynasty, Golden Thai Village and Bowl & Grill (the latter two also operating a stall of their own in the same coffeeshop).
Between ANL Nasi Lemak and Colonel Wings, we found Colonel Wing’s offerings to be a little bit more outstanding than that of ANL Nasi Lemak’s in terms of execution. We opted for the 3 pieces Wingettes and 3 pieces Drumlets (there is also a bigger set that comprises of 5 pieces of each available) — there is a myriad of sauces and powders to choose from though we found ourselves opting for the Tom Yum instead. The fried chicken pieces are freshly fried upon order so they actually arrived the table being piping hot; the golden brown batter being immensely crispy while the flesh within is juicy and tender — noticed how they also didn’t brine the chicken too much here considering how they were supposed to either come with sauce or powder. Whilst we opted for Tom Yum, we found the sauce tasting nothing quite close to it; instead the flavours seem rather reminiscent of another sauce that is listed on the menu but not the one that we opted for — Curry Cheese, for how it carried a note similar to Thai Red Curry but with cheesy touch akin to that of powdered cheese. Those who do not prefer the sauce that they have opted for can also dip the fried chicken in the Thai Sweet Chili sauce that they have thoughtfully included with every order.
Probably wouldn’t make the special trip down to Simei for ANL Nasi Lemak but Colonel Wings does seem like a pretty decent dining option in the neighbourhood — perhaps even good to pair with beer as a bar bite for those looking to just settle for an alcoholic session with fried food in the heartlands …",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/1c299c981ccb27766881917624_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

The egg is fluffy but tender and moist inside. The high proportion of egg to flour made it feel less starchy and more rich in terms of the yolk. The oyster is the taste of seafood. The moist oyster creates a mini explosion of juices, an excellent complement to the egg. The sweet and sour chilli shared similarities with thai sweet chilli but with a chinese fusion twist to it. An outstanding dish for its price!

Delivery",,Claypot Chicken Rice,"HIDDEN GEM: Decent Claypot Chicken Rice at affordable prices. (S$5.00) Until I stumbled upon a Claypot Chicken Rice stall from a Malaysia Boleh franchise located in Simei Eastpoint Mall.
Before savouring any Claypot Chicken Rice, the secret is to mix the rice and sauces well. You know you’re good to go when every grain of rice is coated beautifully golden brown. Let’s get started! The fragrant rice remains moist and tender after being exposed to extreme heat. A light smoky charcoal aroma diffuses into the surrounding air. The chicken chunks are smooth on the surface. Tender, juicy and chewy! My favourite is the chinese sausage pieces with a flavourful sweet-salty combination like “bak kwa” (barbecued pork jerky). Paired with the classic minced garlic and cut chillies in dark soy sauce, it brings the flavour to the next level. The best part is when you reach the bottom of the claypot. I love the layer of crispy charred rice. The contrast in textures is extraordinary. Although the chicken rice was lacking in fragrance, it was relatively good for its price.

Delivery",,"The previous food court at Eastpoint Mall has been changed to Malaysia Boleh by Fei Siong Group, which is excellent news as Easties now do not need to travel to the far West for it.","Most of the stalls here are similar to the other outlet and we got so excited that we might have just over-ordered for the three of us. What you see in this image is just round 1 of our orders and there are rounds 2 and 3 that followed up. Pictured is the char siew noodles, which is not the best char siew that you will ever eat, but it’s definitely a cut above the regular roast meat stalls in food courts as it is nicely charred and caramelised. It’s different from the wanton mee char siew that’s artificially coloured and taste like paper, the ones here has a good meat to fat ratio with a nice sweet finish. Though the flavours didn’t manage to penetrate into the meat itself, every piece is very decent to be eaten when you’re here.

Western",,Roasted Half Chicken Set Meal,"It's a quiet weekend here at Han's, and I felt like having more protein tonight, so I ordered this Roasted Half Chicken Set Meal (S$16.80) which comes with a drink and a bowl of Soup of the Day. I enjoyed eating the perfectly roasted poultry on its own without any sauce, but dipping it into the mushroom sauce is also not bad. The fact is that while the soup is probably something not worth raving about, I had a good time appreciating the roasted skin -- smooth and slurpy! *slurp*",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/598dc5790de22fe91161481882_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Western",,Sirloin Steak and Grilled Prawns,"Walked past this place so many times and finally got to try their food. Went for the 180g sirloin with some juicy grilled prawns ($16.90) and the sides were the hot steamed veggie and baked potato (no butter, cause health).
Wow their steak is super bomb; it was so perfectly cooked. I had it medium and it was delightfully tender with a lovely pink center despite it being a rather small piece of meat. And so juicy too; juices were flowing out when I cut into it. So satisfying to take a huge bite and feel the juices spurt onto my tongue. The veggies were delicious and garlicky. :) I almost wish I ordered double sides of the veggies because they were so good.
The prawns were pretty meh. Well grilled but slightly overcooked and a bit small. And only two prawns. But I guess thats normal for such a place.
Still, that steak is so good that its more than enough to cover up for all the other flaws. And the service was excellent, with the friendly manager taking and serving our orders really efficiently.

Western",,Gourmet Three Eggs Omelette $11.8,"I came with no expectations after my less than stellar experience last time round, but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this classically executed omelette. The fluffy exterior yielded to an ever so slightly runny core specked with squares of ham within. On the side were no-frills baked beans, an ultra-crispy hashbrown, and thick, fluffy squares of brioche. The portions here are very generous and I was struggling to finish my omelette, but the scenic view of Bedok Reservoir and idyllic peacefulness of my surroundings meant I could take my time on a lazy Sunday morning.

(Like y'know some places serve lasagna with insanely sour tomato sauce?!??? How do you even eat that ugh)
The wings and nachos are great too. But I do not recommend their pizzas. And root beer float is fantastic as well (served in a large mug!)

This stall is one of the more popular stall in the area selling traditional minced meat noodles. By traditional meaning they don't have any mushrooms, fish ball or fishcakes.
It's one of the stalls I think that is almost on par with bedok85's minced meat noodles.
🍜 The broth is really flavourful with not just the sweetness of the minced meat, it also has that umami from the fried garlic, pork lard and the flat fish used in to Cook the broth. The fried garlic and pork lard adds on to the texture and flavour of the dish too.
The noodles are springy yet chewy at the same time. This is the texture I like. The filling in the wonton is well seasoned but the skin is a tad thick for me. Meat balls are decent.",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/33f3b3f3eef989f308721923984_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

They give a good selection of vegetables and meat with the set lunch that will leave you plenty full. The chicken collagen broth is so-so (I would not order it again as there is a surcharge of 3.90 for it), but the Mala soup is pretty decent.
The free sauces are also quite nice accompanied, especially their signature chilli.
Free flow drinks are an add-on at 0.60++ with every set purchased which is more than reasonable.",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/2f18a08c854e1ec4df961655660_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

*Halal-certified",Review on Grilled Salmon Fillet ($16.80),"Date visited: 9/6/2018 (Sat, 9pm)
Managed to reach in time to place our order for the grilled set meals before the kitchen closes.
If you come in slightly after 9pm, there's only soup left.
The grilled sets come with two sides; chose buttered corn and potato salad.
The grilled salmon was fresh. Accompanying sauce was alright. Couldn't really tell what type of sauce it was though.
Buttered corn was very oily and rather salty for some parts. I gave up trying to finish the corn after a while.
Potato salad was ok. Potatoes soft, but not mushy. Creamy, savoury but not overly rich. Nice in an average way.",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/2f1246125a3cea959af61642867_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

The soup is notable as well due to its robust and rich profile while being not really spicy. I can imagine this being really lovely in a rainy weather, slurping all noodles together with it! The runny egg yolk with the noodles just makes it even better 😍

Brimming with flavours from the sea, the large hotpot feeds 2 with fresh plump squids, thick fish slices, tiger prawns, mussels, handmade pork balls, mushrooms, eggs and of course Tom Yum Mama noodles. We were pleased at the overall balance of sweet, sour, spicy, herbaceous flavours. In fact, the fresh zesty lime slices was a delightful find compared to the usual kaffir lime leaves along with lemongrass and coriander. You know you are in for an awesome deal when they aren’t stingy on the herbs nor the ingredients for the robust broth. It’s so addictive that it has become a craving on rainy days.

Vegetarian",,Above Average Tasty Vegetarian Fare,"Recently, the Business Development team from Burpple introduced me to this air-conditioned vegetarian eatery near the office. I had been there once before, about two years ago at least, but it was during my visit with the team that had me really open my eyes to the tasty vegetarian options here.
There are two ways to purchase food at this venue. For items listed in their menu (the “Mee Hoon Kueh” is a fave of my colleagues), you order from the counter, but they also have a little set-up within the premises that operates like a “chap chye png” hawker stall. This is where you get to pick and choose a carb (fried beehoon, white or brown rice) and the dishes to go on top.
Based on my last couple of drop-ins for lunch, I found the fried beehoon flavourful and the dishes I tried, well-cooked. My recommendation would be to order a mix of the stewed and the crispy.
During lunchtime, it can get packed here with the working crowd but fortunately, there is ample seating. I would suggest arriving earlier if you like to have a wider choice of dishes from the stall because the food moves quickly.",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/23ca4d5e79909cff1121635276_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Vegetarian",,Teriyaki Tofu Brown Rice ($5.30),"I ended up at this vegetarian place as no other eateries in the vicinity were open on a public holiday morning. The wide range of dishes they offer made it hard for me to decide, but I eventually opted for the safe (and healthier) choice of brown rice and stir-fried vegetables with firm tofu pieces in a light teriyaki sauce. Verdict: it was quite tasty in a clean way with the texture of the vegetables done just right.",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/23ca4d382b2bdc661f21385845_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

A vegetarian hidden find 🌿☘️🌱 @yuan_bistro located in CT HUB is a relatively underrated vegetarian restaurant only known to surrounding workaholics😂 they serve a wide range of Asian fusion cuisines and tzechar! The tzechar’s queue was too Long so I tried their hot stone claypot rice, fish soup noodle and herbal noodles.🤤 They are so good😍 the sauce of the claypot rice is up a notch from the typical dark sauce, with added savory which blends perfectly with the mock meat🙃 the fish soup taste like fish soup with mock fish meat that achieved the same fish slice texture😱 together with the crunch of mushroom bits, seriously can’t tell the difference. The winner for me is the herbal noodle⭐️ if you take a close look, the noodles are made out of vegetables🙌 the herbal soup looks bland and clear at first sight but NOOOO... it’s a healthy herb slap to your tongue and it stays🌝✨highly recommended to give this place a try! Don’t underestimate Vegetarian cuisine people🌚 ✨⭐️✨

Delivery",,Located at Changi City Point is a beautifully designed restaurant that exudes a modern Vietnamese feel while dishing out food that will transport you momentarily back to Vietnam.,"Start off with a glass of Iced Vietnamese Egg Coffee ($4.90), that was originated from the streets of Hanoi, for that boost of sweetness with a smooth velvety finish before diving in straight for the Spring Roll Platter ($19.90) that is an essential order for me whenever I am dining in a Vietnamese restaurant. The platter comes with an assortment of fresh spring rolls that are packed with prawns, mushroom and tofu, deep fried ones that contain seafood and mustard lettuce rolls with grilled beef. There are two accompanying different dips which you can alternate to your liking.
Pho is like the iconic national dish of Vietnam, and you can get various interpretations of it across the country and beyond. The broth is boiled for hours and each slurp has to deliver a soothing and soul-comforting feel, while packed with flavours. I had the Wagyu Beef Pho ($15.90) which comes with a bowl of rice noodles in the restaurant’s slow-cooked bone broth, fresh bean sprouts, cilantro, basil, cut red chillis and a side of hoisin sauce and sriracha to be added into the broth for flavouring. The protein comes from the slices of wagyu beef that are hanging like a blanket on a clothing line, which you give it a quick dip into the piping hot broth before eating it. The other pho that we have tried is the Spicy Tiger Prawn Pho Soup ($15.90) which comes in a thick rich broth that might get a little too heavy towards the end.
To accompany the pho, the Signature Hand Pulled Grilled Spring Chicken ($18.80) is an excellent choice as the chicken is well marinated and has been butterflied before going into the grill to ensure that it is evenly cooked. The chicken dish comes with fresh vegetables, paper rice and a spicy herb salt for you to make your own grilled chicken spring rolls.

The Da Nong Pork Noodle Soup features special pork bone broth — almost akin to a light Tom Yum soup without being too punchy in terms of spiciness, yet coming with and evident hint of lemongrass; a contrast to the beefy, light-tasting Pho broth we are often exposed to. Rice noodles were smooth and silky; absolutely slurpy, while the condiments such as the prawn was fresh — also comes with fried spring rolls which were crisp and meaty, rice cracker, assortment of greens, and hard-boiled egg.

Manna Bistro & Grill,3 REVIEWS,0 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$20/pax,Western,,Black Pepper Chicken Chop w/ Mac & Cheese & Charred Cauliflower | $10.90,"Found my new favourite place for affordable Western fare. What’s more, it’s located in a mall! Located very ironically opposite the Korean restaurant ManNa in Changi City Point, Manna Bistro and Grill offers a wide range of western food such as pastas, burgers, chickens, and steaks. Not forgetting, they have drinks which allow you to have a chill night out with friends. At just $10.90, this black pepper chicken chop came with a choice of 2 sides — out of 18 sides I got to choose from. Went for Mac and cheese and charred cauliflower simply because I was spoilt for choice, and thought that both options were pretty good. Chicken chop was juicy and black pepper sauce was well, peppery enough to my liking. Now that Astons has increased their prices by a bit, I am definitely coming back here to satisfy my chicken chop cravings!

we got 2 original wolf burgers, 1 magic shrooms and 1 miso tofu!! i tried the both beef patties one before and they are all amazingggggg!!
the ground patties are honestly so flavourful, juicy and well cooked! i love how u can choose between medium and well done (i always choose the former) i also love how they melt the cheese so it just encompasses the patty + not to mention the buns omg they are perfectly brown on the top w sesame seeds and inside is buttery yet light and fluffy.
tried the tofu miso tdy for the first time and i was so blown away???? the tofu was tender yet compact (not crumbly at all it rly held up well) and it complemented the miso sauce so well + the avocado slices and vege were damn fresh! i mean if u were rly craving a burger then it’s different HAHA but it’s rly darn tasty so it’s super gd as a substitute esp for vegetarians!
we got truffle fries and cheese fries! nth much to shout abt, their fries are the chunky thicker ones that my fam prefers! we liked the cheese fries btr as the cheese was generous VS the truffle whose smell was rly strong but taste was rly lacking!

Even though it is one of the new “Basic Burgers” at Wolf Burgers, I don’t think there is anything basic about this “Nasi Lemak Fried Fish Burger”.
The fish patty stands out for being impressively crunchy. Its battered coating resembles the light kind you find at certain “goreng pisang” (banana fritters) stalls (squint and you can see the millions of micro-holes in it). Packed with the fried fish between the buns are a fried egg, thick slices of cucumber and a housemade sweet chilli sambal that delivers a good kick of spiciness.

Durian Fairy,1 REVIEW,0 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$5/pax,"Desserts
Cakes",,Durian Pancake,"Was pretty much casually going around the Kopitiam food court at Tampines Mall whilst randomly checking out the shops around the shopping mall and found a stall named Durian Fairy around the beverage stall — something which we did not recall coming across previously. It seems that Kopitiam had been maximising the stall units that they had previously dedicated to their beverage stalls — the way that Durian Fairy is being set up does remind us of Kenji Taco Sushi; also another concept that is awkwardly tucked within the beverage stall at Kopitiam in Northpoint City by the folks of Fuji Izakaya Bar & KTV Pub that serves up Japanese Hyogo Oyster and Taco Sushi. Unlike Kenji Taco Sushi, Durian Fairy is predominantly a dessert kiosk; the various items which are being stocked up in the display chiller at the counter or Durian Fairy includes that of individual pieces / slices of pastries / cakes, as well as packaged cheese cakes, Musang King Pulp, Durian Mousse and freeze-dried durian that is of Fairy Port brand — the same folks whom operate Durian Fairy. For those looking for something more substantial, Durian Fairy does serve up waffles with ice-cream, as well Pancakes with various toppings to choose from as well.
Given its price tag of $3, we weren’t quite sure on what to expect for its Durian Pancakes. Based on our experience with how it is like for similar dishes served by other durian specialty stores, the Durian Pancakes are typically served in a form of a small pancake with durian mousse being spread in the middle — the final product being more of a taco-shaped affair. What we were pretty impressed with Durian Fairy was how its Durian Pancake were actually made-to-order from the griddle using a batter that has been mixed beforehand; something we were not quite expecting from a kiosk like that — so kudos to them for doing so to deliver freshness for their pancakes to their patrons. There is around a 10 minute waiting time for the Durian Pancake; Durian Fairy serves up their Durian Pancakes in a form of a stack of two pancakes with durian mousse spread in between. The pancake can be said to be crisp on the exterior whilst soft and fluffy inside; not greasy as well, though our preference would be for the pancake to come entirely fluffy — the crispness of the browned side was not quite our thing, though we would like to think that some would be fine with this. The durian mousse spread in the middle was one that was smooth and a bit ice-cream like as one would put it; comes with quite a pungent note of the king of fruits, though those looking for fibrous durian flesh may be a little disappointing to lovers of the fruit in general.
We would say that it isn’t quite fair to comment about the overall food quality of the items available at Durian Fairy considering how they do carry quite a wide array of durian desserts on their menu — the Durian Pancake is just one of the many items that they have to offer. That being said, the Durian Pancake was something which we we found to be of a decent offering considering its price tag. At $3, there isn’t much that one can really complain about it — it does resolve the cravings that one has for durian desserts; no doubt there aren’t fibrous flesh with the durian mousse spread in between, though we would reckon the item commanding a higher price tag if it did. The Durian Pancake was also an item which we found to have come in a rather substantial portion size; one that could be shared as an after-meal dessert between two smaller eaters — this is because it comes with two full-sized pancakes here rather than being a bite-sized treat that it usually is at other places. Prices of the various items at Durian Fairy generally vary with the type of item that it is — this includes Swiss Roll slices that are priced at $2, and Durian Mousse at $6; there is also a Durian Pizza which costs $6 as well. While we would find that Durian Fairy isn’t a spot that we will be rushing to plan for a revisit soon, it does serve as an interesting dining option to go for in a food court setting.",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/1685316223_review_image1969456_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

We got the sea salt cream coffee ($6) which is like an Americano topped with whipped cream and sprinkled with sea salt flakes. Their whipped cream isn't the ones that come out of a spray can, but instead they are hand whipped fresh by the staff. The whipped cream consistency isn't too hard nor too runny, and it really was perfect with the aromatic coffee beneath! This makes the refreshing Americano richer and yet not too surfeiting. The sprinkle of sea salt flakes was an interesting touch, as the savouriness comes quite strong in the aftertaste.
Im sure their other cream coffee such as the black sesame one will be even better and I am already looking forward to try soon 😍

For starters, there is the OMNI Spam Fries ($11.80) that comes with a curry dipping sauce that you can snack on while you wait for the mains to arrive. For this plant-based menu, there are a total of three pasta dishes with the tomato base of OMNI Meatball Bolognese ($14.90), cream base of OMNI Luncheon Carbonara Pasta ($14.90) and my top pick, the OMNI Strips Aglio Oglio ($14.90). The spaghetti in the aglio oglio is simply tossed in olive oil, garlic and chilli for that spicy kick which the OMNI strips added a nice bite and flavour to the overall dish.
Besides dining in the restaurants, you can also order the plant-based dishes on Oddle (link below) and there is an ongoing promotion whereby you can enjoy a set meal with drinks at $29.90. The meal comes with a choice of a plant-based pasta, OMNI Spam Fries and canned drink.

~Sausage Platter
~Truffle Cream Pasta

Their signature Rotisserie Roasted Chicken is succulent and really well-seasoned, and I personally liked having the Black Pepper Sauce to go along with the chicken! The Truffle Cream Pasta was surprising really creamy and their corn muffins are always a good side to have! Will give a special mention to the other 2 sides (Potato Salad & Coleslaw) too, we really enjoyed having them alongside the mains! Safe to say, we were all belly-satisfied at the end of the meal!
They have a Christmas Family Feast too, that serves 8-10 pax for larger group gatherings at home (PSA: you can have max. 5 guests in your home as per current restrictions).

Western",*Halal-certified,Kenny’s Chicken & Pasta Meal (Black Pepper) | $13.90,"Was excited to hear the Kenny Rogers is back in Singapore. A family-friendly restaurant where I celebrated occasions at, I am glad that now more families can finally do the same (Who can forget The Café Cartel). With all that excitement however, I was not as impressed with the food as I would have liked to be. The chicken itself was a tad bit dry, but understandably so. You can also ask for more sauce if it’s not enough. Plus points as the chicken skin was tasty and well roasted, with the crinkly sound when u tap it with your fork. Then again, it was just a decent rotisserie chicken that you could perhaps easily get at a cheaper price elsewhere. Here, you are indeed paying for service and ambience, which are fair considerations in every meal.
I discourage choosing the pasta option as it felt like typical school canteen fare. Tasteless and dry.
Ultimately, I’m not sure if I would return. As mentioned, it is relatively affordable with the excellent service provided and laid back ambience. But don’t come with high expectations.

Delivery",,It’s evident that we love our chicken rice with so many stalls competing for the accolade of being lauded the best in the country.,"One of the more established brands, Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice was founded in 1989 and I remember eating it at its original Novena outlet when I was much younger and the brand has since grown to a few outlets across the country. Served with rice that’s cooked in a chicken stock and an aromatic mix of ginger and garlic, the fragrant rice alone is enough to tingle your senses. The best partner for it is of course the steamed or roasted chicken that is tender to the bite but with a different flavour profile. Personally, I prefer the steamed chicken for its silky smooth texture of the skin and the soya sauce and sesame oil mix that is poured onto it.

Hot Pot
Delivery
Japanese",,For Japanese Shabu with Unique Soup Bases,"Affordably priced from $22.99 for dinner and conveniently located in malls like Suntec City, Causeway Point and Orchard Central, this chain restaurant specializing in Japanese shabu is the one to head to when your soup craving strikes. Unless you intend to chow down on unlimited servings of sushi, skip the Orchard Central outlet (dinner from $24.99) and save the extra bucks to add on $1.99 for free flow soft drinks and ice cream. Choose two out of six soup bases — play it safe with sukiyaki, tonkotsu shoyu or yuzu collagen stock, or try the monthly specials like assam curry or herbal chicken and barley. Every broth is flavourful and not watered down, and the refills are the same as the soup stock you get in the beginning. The catch? You only have 90 minutes to eat, so act fast. We recommend ordering more of the thinly shaved beef — it cooks fast and tastes similar to the one from Yoshinoya (you know which ones we're talking about). Then, head straight for the mussels, clams and DIY meat balls on bamboo sticks — much like the ones from Tsukada Nojo, except you get to make your own here! There is a large variety of dipping sauces at Shabu Sai, with plenty of condiments to complement.

Ordered a medium rare, while my dad who always goes for a medium well mentioned how it’s a bit hard at that doneness. So choose to your preferences friends! The dish was accompanied with a smooth truffle mash and veges that went well altogether. Went for the garlic sauce that paired well with the steak! You get to choose between mushroom, garlic and black pepper sauce.
Definitely go for the steak if you are visiting Meathouse, previously tried the Joper Oven Steak with Pasta and the cooking method made the beef tough which wasn’t to my liking.",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/4c46c14a2a852107ff01819365_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Part of the seasonal menu, to celebrate this Hari Raya Puasa period.
.
A whole roasted spring chicken, with crisp salty savoury skin and tender moist sweet savoury chicken meat, is served alongside crisp juicy strips of cucumber and turnip, in a rich, thick rojak gravy.
.
Garnished with crushed peanuts, this has a piquant sour sweet savoury shrimpy flavour.
.
Delicious, tastes exactly as what we'd expected from a dish named 'rojak chicken'.

Pasta",*Halal-certified,Josper Oven-Grilled Striploin Steak with Pasta ($16++),"Located on the fifth storey of the east-side mall that is Century Square, The MeatHöuse is a Halal-certified casual steakhouse conceived by none other than Chef Benny Se Teo and his team from Eighteen Chefs. Unlike most steakhouses, The MeatHöuse provides diners with a modern casual setting similar to that of a café, perfect for a laid-back afternoon sirloin. Their French Fries with Truffles ($10++) were served with a generous mound of shaved parmesan cheese and discernible bits of truffle. While the anticipated punch of the familiar scent and taste of the occasionally-overused truffle oil was not there, the fries were on a whole new level of flavoursome, maintaining a crisp exterior with warmth and fluff on the inside. I had the Josper Oven-Grilled Striploin Steak with Pasta ($16++), which came with a simply grilled slab of striploin, a salad almost overly-dressed with sesame oil and aglio olio which I requested to be served with linguine rather than spaghetti. Certainly a joint to check out if you’re in the east and looking for a meat feast.",https://burpple-3.imgix.net/foods/2fe17deb33aa3d4cdf401720741_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Pasta",*Halal-certified,For Australian Tajima Wagyu Striploin Steak,"Owner of E18hteen Chefs, Benny Se Teo, strikes again with this halal grillhouse concept in Tampines. Burppler Muriel AvdH suggests zooming in on the steaks for the best experience here. We recommend the Striploin Steak ($45 for 200g) – think spot-on medium rare and tender wagyu beef, which comes with a mini dinner roll and choice of sauce (garlic, mushroom and black pepper).

Ps: Naked oysters are the best. These toppings here (grapefruit & ikura in the middle; hua tiao ebi at the bottom) don't do much for how decadent & creamy these oysters are on their own.

Pasta",,"This Is It, Cap(ellini)","It may be a simple dish with few ingredients, but the depth of flavours is charmingly complex. @tipsypenguinsg crabmeat capellini ($16++) is built on appetising al dente capellini surrounded by a moat of luscious lobster bisque, and finished with an ample amount of crabmeat and a little bit of ikura (salmon roe).⠀
⠀
Tipsy Penguin’s menu describes this dish as ‘generous flakes of crabmeat tossed in homemade lobster bisque & ikura. We are not kidding when we say generous’. Well, they took the words right outta my mouth. Y’all see that abundance of honest to goodness crabmeat? Yeah, they deserve to toot their own horn, cause they ain’t lying about the amount of crab in the dish.⠀
⠀
The lobster bisque was fully loaded with unctuous umami, balanced with a little sweetness & brininess for maximum flavour force. It made for a perfect stock for the fresh crab & pasta, and the little bursts of salt from the explosive ikura serves to heighten the sublime sapidity of the lobster bisque.⠀

Even at my request of less spicy, it’s indecently incendiary. Yep, I was sweating bullets after just a couple of bites, and I am so grateful for the pints of Hofbrau wheat beer going at a rate of $12++ a pint. Yes, I had three. The spicy stingray is my excuse, shush. As for the stingray flesh itself, it’s fresh, supple and modestly moist. It’s plenty meaty too, so you don’t feel like you’ve been ripped off.⠀

The menu may be more worldwide than Pitbull, but each dish is decently done. This plate of Hokkien Mee ain’t gonna win any pretty food contests, but it’s a pretty good representation of #uglydelicious. The tremendously T H I C C noodles are braised in that gravy, whose only fault is being a touch too sweet for my tastes, and tossed in a smattering of seafood.⠀

The sapid & sweet soy-based sauce lends luscious life to the otherwise bland seafood. The squid is cooked to perfection, possessing the right balance of chew & suppleness. The duo of prawns, however, weren’t fresh and had gone a little mushy. Bit of a shame, as the prawns were the thing that dragged the dish down with their lack of freshness.⠀

Good ambience and good service. The food is generally good with some disappointments.

Well known for mouth-watering dim sum delic...",Braised Pig Trotter with Vinegar ($9.80++),"The outlet at Chinatown serves traditonal dishes too, such as steamed cai xin with minced pork and Chinese sausage, and this 猪脚醋. I like that it's full of ginger aroma and the trotters are tender and succulent after simmering in the aromatic, sweet and sour vinegar. Some will like that it's not too sour, though I like my pig trotter vinegar to be more sour for more kick.

@yumchasg has a new range of dim sum that is perfect for Christmas! Available at both their outlets and the new Express kiosk, the roasted turkey bun & snowman bao is available at $3.80++ for a set of 2 pcs. The Roasted turkey is a baked bao containing turkey ham and pork. Its like an upscale char siew bao with pepper and onions. Rather good combination i must say. The snowman bao contains lotus paste + roasted chestnut in the body while the head consist of redbean. .
🍴
The piglets and panda baos are available at $1.90 each at the Yumcha express kiosk. It comes in a variety of flavours and can change daily. Flavours include matcha, black sesame, lotus paste, redbean and custard. Plus enjoy 10% off when you spend $10!! The basket of mixed flavoured baos as seen in the photos are only available on weekends at the outlets. .
🍴
Salted egg custard buns ($4.50++ for 1 set of 3 pc) are also not spared from Christmas. Imprinted with cute designs made of food grade ink. This is definitely a fun way to get your kids involved. .
🍴
One point to note is that baos should always be eaten warm, so that the skin is soft and fluffy while the fillings will be warm and flowy. .
🍴
Christmas feasting can definitely be more interesting than the typical turkey and Angmoh Food!

Ordered the four season cheese tea. Tea tasted similar to those chinese tea served at chinese restaurant but sweetened just to my liking. Cheese foam on the other hand was....... not within my expectation. Honestly it tasted like sweetened dough mixture, without a hint of any cheese taste. (Imagine the taste of flour, water and sugar mix together and drinking it. Really bad.) My friend totally agreed with me.
Drinking the tea on it's own was fine but when mixed together it just tasted like drinking sweetened raw dough mixture. Truly not to my liking and also a waste of my money as I only drank a few sip. Luckily I used the burpple 1-for-1 so the damage wasn't that bad.
Also staff should be more knowledgeable about the drinks offered. Here's a small dialogue of what happened.
Me: Erm, what is this four season tea?
Employee: It's a type of tea.
Me: .......(Anything else that I don't know?)
Luckily another employee replied that it was a type of green tea. Anyway I ordered it as it was an item recommended on the menu. Afterwards..... regrets T.T
Maybe next time I'll stick to normal milk tea? IF there's a next time for here. Overall take my advice and skip the cheese tea.",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/2f29a367a6b387654e421810120_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

To usher in the Lunar New Year, Gravitea has introduced 2 new creations – Berry Orange ($4.50 for 500ml) & Matcha Mango ($6.90 for 700ml). I tried their Berry Orange, which is a milk-based drink with orange juice & strawberry syrup, topped with slices of fresh strawberries. 🍓🍊 This is a sweet concoction that is quite smooth on the palate, bearing a slight resemblance to those bottled yoghurt smoothies! 🤣 Like the hint of citrusy zest that came through, balancing out the sweetness of the strawberry syrup. Reminded me a little of Macs’ strawberry sundae! 😅
.
Also managed to get my hands on their Rose Oolong Cheese Tea ($5.40) from their normal menu & I actually liked it better! 💕 The cheese foam wasn’t overwhelming but added a creamy texture & slight savoury-sweet flavour to the drink. The tea base itself was the star of the drink - u can really smell the fragrance of the oolong tea & it was without any unpleasant astringent taste. 👍🏻 Would have preferred a strong floral note as the rose flavour was extremely subtle, but the nice oolong cheese tea left me satisfied. 😋😋😋

Bubble Tea",,NEW CNY Festive drinks:Mango Matcha [$6.90]Berries Orange [$4.50]Box of 4 🐷 Pineapple tarts .,"Available for a limited time only and in conjunction with the upcoming Chinese New Year, @graviteabarsg has launched 2 new festive drinks - Mango Matcha & Berries Orange. The combination of Mango Matcha can be an acquired experience, with the tangy sour note of mango adding another dimension of flavour to the vegetal, lingering bitter undertone of matcha. On the other hand, the berries orange tasted pretty similar to a freshly squeezed orange juice, with a tangy sour note that would serve as a great perk-me-up on a lethargic, hot afternoon. Apart from the two new festive drinks, there’s also macaron-alike pineapple tarts that’s moulded to perfection- just in time for the Year of the Pig🐷 🐽! Apart from the 2 CNY beverages, I also tried the regular drink of Dragonfruit Smoothies Cheese [$6.90] that comes topped with a thick layer of creamy cheese foam, adding a subtle tinge of saltiness to the antioxidant-packed dragonfruit smoothie .

It’s basically a vanilla frappucino, with a disinclined tinge of tartness, complete with a shot of sweetened green tea syrup. The drink’s pointless familiarity left me confused as a result, even though it wasn’t something that I…really minded?
To dynamise it though, I shoved my straw all the way to the bottom of the cup and sipped on it while I gradually moved it towards the top. It’s a convenient way to get my gush of sweetness, which, by the way, did put me off a little at first. But not long after, I decided to give in to my sugar cravings which had been tame for quite some time. Ah well. I’d like to think of doing that as getting a little bit of everything, though I’m not quite sure if I am able to define everything? 😂
It really wasn’t bad, to be honest. I think it just felt like almost every other Starbucks drink – very ordinary, unable to fully satisfy, and lacking of an import. (7.1/10)",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/59725cf41a81e07a34c1627245_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Zi Char",,Salted Egg Chicken Rice ($6.00),"Stumbled across this Zi Char restaurant in the ulu part of Tampines, hidden beneath the rows of industrial buildings. This is situated in a food court below Block 9007, a canteen catering to the lunch and dinner crowds of office workers. The storefront is huge and it's kitchen occupies a big space. I settled for the one person portion of 咸蛋鸡丁饭 (Salted Egg Chicken Rice) priced at $6. They also offer salted egg pork ribs with rice, also at $6. The sauce itself was of a paler yellow and had a slightly underwhelming salted egg flavour. However, this is probably due to my greedy self requesting for more salted egg sauce, thus they made it more diluted and watery. The boneless chicken pieces, however, were nicely fried and tender. If only the sauce had packed more salted egg flavour, this would have been a winner. 🥚
Note to self: Don't request for more salted egg sauce next time.
Nevertheless, I will be back to try their other items on the menu. 😃

Chinese",日日昇麻辣香鍋,"With so many mala stalls and concepts opening up in recent times, it’s tough to stand out in the sea of competition.","What is difficult is to find the right balance of spiciness, savouriness and numbing sensation in a mala xiangguo and we were lucky to have discovered that at Ri Ri Sheng Mala Hotpot. It was a rather impromptu decision to have mala for dinner and after searching around the vicinity, Ri Ri Sheng Mala Hotpot popped up in our search efforts. We picked the usual ingredients that we would normally get for mala xiangguo like lotus roots, pork belly, luncheon meat and instant noodles, stir fried in the 小辣 option as this is our first time trying, we do not want it to be too spicy.
To our amazement, Ri Ri Sheng Mala Hotpot has all the right elements of a good mala xiangguo, with the spicy and numbing sensation in every bite. We clearly didn’t expect it to be this good, and because of that we will definitely be back again soon to try a second time.

Well seasoned, and quite straight Forward with the spicy and the numbing tastes, without much else. Still enjoyable though, esp due to the generous portions
P.S. as my buddy ordered for me this time, i have gained experience about ingredients choice since hes quite a mala fanatic. Do away with the juicy veggies like cabbage if u want a punch in the bowl. Those veggies dilute the spices quite a bit and results in less punch
Potatoes are fantastic as somehow theyre less spicy but just as fragrant, meaning you can keep popping slice after slice
Have to admit sausages are quite flavourful, even though i dont get it due to it bring unhealthy normally
Oyster mushroom still doesnt pick up sauce well couple with the fact that it's juicy, but enoki does that quite well

Chinese",日日昇麻辣香鍋,For Modestly Spiced Mala Xiang Guo,"For pick-your-own mala bowls, this stall at Tampines Street 81 nails it with a spot-on balance of flavour, heat and the numbing tingliness characteristic of mala dishes. According to Tastemaker Wei Zhi Chiang, this stall is modest on the spice level so don't be afraid to scale up if you're a spice fiend. Otherwise, most would do well with the medium level, which offers a slow burn. The ingredients here are really fresh. Tastemaker Zhihui Lim loves the crunchy lotus root and tender pork slices, while Tastemaker Marc T. really likes how the silky glass noodles soaked up the flavourful sauce. The sauce is also neither overly salty nor oily — a big plus in our books! Prices average at $1 for vegetables and $2 for meats. Portions are pretty generous, so pace yourself.

Rice was extremely fluffy while the curry had a full body from the chickpeas, and it was more tangy than savoury. While it may appear mild at first, there's this heat which burns the back of your throat. Definitely the best briyani I've had by far if only the chicken was remotely tender. Hopefully it's because it's the end of the day and it tastes much better when it's freshly cooked. Do note that their closing time vary wildly from 1pm to 4pm depending on the business.

Halal",*Muslim-owned,Best Briyani…In Tampines?!,"[Halal] Under normal circumstances, you’ll never catch me having a plate of Nasi Briyani to myself. Not that I have anything against it, but it just feels like a dish suited for grand occasions, namely weddings. Yet, here I am, trying Shaik Mohamad’s Nasi Briyani Ayam ($5.50) after a Grab uncle recommended and lauded this. So how does it fare?
It was actually very good. Now I know briyanis aren’t exactly gourmet or anything to critically assess, but really there are a couple of things about this that are worth mentioning. The long-grain basmati rice and the curry were both so fragrant and deliciously seasoned with flavour, that they were essentially a crime. And the huge piece of chicken that came along with it…holy. The meat was tender to a fault and carries some of the spices that were cooked with the cauldron-size pot of rice which made it incredible. In short, this was a full-bodied briyani that eclipses virtually other renditions that I've had, maybe with an exception of one or two.
My only gripe though is with the smell. Forgive me, for I personally find it hard to stand even a whiff of lamb and mutton. They are notorious for having a pretty pungent, hot rubber-like smell, which was quite detectable in this. If you’re like me and find it difficult to tolerate, you might actually be convinced by that alone to give it a miss, but trust me – don’t be quick to dismiss it because as the old adage goes, smells can be deceiving…right?

The stall owners will add in water and herbs daily and over the years, the flavours have intensified till umami stage. I don’t know how true is that but if someone can verify it for me, that would be great). Nonetheless, all the checkboxes first a good kway chap has been ticked from the flavour-packed zhup to innards that are cleaned thoroughly. Oh and did I mention that they actually make their own chilli dipping sauce which you must absolutely get to pair with the braised ingredients.

The staff was really helpful and told us that we could swap the fresh milk for their milk tea instead. We did that (opted for 30% sugar because Chiyin prefers her bbt not-so-sweet) and found a new favourite. 50% sugar might be better because their 30% was pretty diluted as compared to other BBT brands. Thankfully, the sweet potato paste was a great complement and was sweet enough to add more taste to the milk tea. We chose the sweet potato paste instead of yam paste because it’s something we haven’t seen elsewhere! The taro pearls were really QQ too!

I wouldn't say that it enhanced the dosa in any way lah, but it was at least worth a mention! In fact, perhaps the only thing worth any. 🤔
To my disappointment though, this had already regressed to room temperature by the time I got it. The crisp, which is what makes any dosa, was missing. Sigh.

Pan Seared Fish with Cajun Cream Sauce($12)🥰
2 pieces of smooth battered fish served with creamy & spicy cajun cream sauce, a lemon wedges, mashed potato and mixed vegetables.
Silky tender fish, thin and smooth golden brown batter with a nice crisp, and not too oily. Perfecto!
Cajun Cream Sauce pairing was awesome.

Creole Beef Stew with Rice($12)😮
Chunky beef stewed with crunchy mixed vegetables, drizzled with nacho cheese and served with fluffy long grain rice.
Beef were succulent and generous. Vegetables were natural. Stew sauce was tangy, savoury and saucey. Meat taste better here as it soaked up the flavourful sauce, making it more juicy.
The rice was prepared wonderfully also. Flavourful and fragrant.

The tender chicken was superior compared to the pork, though I’d still eat the latter anytime!

Western",,Mixed Grill = Chicken Chop + Pork Chop,"I believe we all have that favourite neighbourhood Western food stall that we frequent from young, our hawker alternative to the many fast-food chains. And hidden in a kopitiam at Tampines Street 81, we might have found one of the best in the area and I certainly wouldn’t mind traveling from my secluded West to have it again (psst it is really quite good).
Rivaling the quality and prices of established cafes serving western fare, what really stood out for me were Tokyo Western’s well-marinated meat cuts. Moist, tender and well-seasoned, all the things that spell a good pork and chicken chop in my books will set you back by a reasonable $8.50. A sizable portion, our order of Mixed Grill also came with the usual beans, fries, toast and cucumber slices? (kinda strange but alright). Both perfectly seared, chicken chop has always been my go-to but their succulent grilled pork chop was a winner. They also offer Sirloin Steak ($8.00) and Lamb Chop ($7.50) if you are looking to treat yourself.

A couple of weeks ago, we were in the far east (i.e. Tampines) to check out what @tokyowesternsg has to offer.
I was not a fan of their pork chop which was rather thin yet a little on the tough side. Their chicken chop fared better but I felt that a thicker cut would have a better bite and texture. Their sauce was decent. And again, they served baked beans instead of coleslaw 😂😂😂

Ambience: 8/10 ❤️❤️❤️❤️🤍
Flavor: 9/10 ❤️❤️❤️❤️🤍
Service: 8/10 ❤️❤️❤️❤️🤍
Overall: 25/30 ❤️❤️❤️❤️🤍
For a second time, I have returned to Ninja Chirashi at Block 824 Tampines Street 81, which is located conveniently across Temasek Polytechnic – approximately 5-minute walk from their Main Gate and 12-minute walk from Tampines West MRT Station.
I have previously done a review of Ninja Chirashi’s Truffle Chirashi on 7 Jul 22, and because the eatery left such an impression on me, I have decided to return a second time to try out their other offerings. If you have yet to see my previous review on Ninja Chirashi, be sure to check it out by scrolling through my Instagram page or my Blogger!
This time, I ordered (1) 3-Way Salmon Don – which includes a mixture of Aburi Salmon, Sashimi Slices, and Ikura to top it off. I also went with a different choice of set meal for this visit, opting for a (2) Pitan Tofu Set with Refillable Hot Tea.
The set meal totalled up to a price of S$20.90, which was a tad pricier than the Truffle Chirashi variant I had previously. By itself, the 3-Way Salmon Don was S$15.90, and the inclusion of the set meal came in at an additional cost of S$5.00.
This visit at Ninja Chirashi had made me fell in love more with the eatery because the consistency of their flavours is no doubt top tier. The Sliced Salmon tasted as fresh as I remembered – if not better, and the inclusion of the Aburi Salmon and Ikura simply gave me so many more variations of flavours to mix-and-match the perfect spoonful of the Don. Speaking of which, the best scoop would be a quarter spoonful of their rice together with a cut of Aburi Salmon, Pitan Tofu, and Ikura. The combination of the subtle sweetness of the Ikura, creamy pungent flavour of the Pitan Tofu, and the savoury Mentaiko Aburi Salmon, will unquestionably give you an explosion of dynamic flavours in your mouth. Even on its own, each individual component paired with the rice will leave you wanting for more. Without the shadow of a doubt, the 3-Way Salmon Don is a clear winner when compared to the Truffle Chirashi.
For that, I give Singapore’s Ninja Chirashi a 9/10 for flavour.
The eatery continued to be manned by one staff, with no signs for further increment of staff. Nevertheless, because I visited during off-peak hours, the staff was visibly more attentive as compared to my prior visit. The eatery was also still playing old j-pop music that I was oh-so-familiar with, which really met the expectations that I had prior the visit.
For that, I give Singapore’s Ninja Chirashi an 8/10 for Service and 8/10 for Ambience.
Overall, Ninja Chirashi at Block 824 Tampines Street 81 scored a solid 25/30 after combining the scores for Flavour, Service, and Ambience. To conclude, this eatery is truly one which I hold in high regards. I would highly recommend the place if you are looking for a chill environment that serves well-priced, yet quality Don with fantastic sides that have consistent flavours and qualities in all your visits.",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/1663490805_review_image1950857_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Ambience: 7/10 ❤️❤️❤️🤍🤍
Flavor: 8/10 ❤️❤️❤️❤️🤍
Service: 9/10 ❤️❤️❤️❤️🤍
Overall: 24/30 ❤️❤️❤️❤️🤍
On a Friday afternoon, I visited Singapore’s Ninja Chirashi, which is located at Tampines Street 81 - approximately 5 minute walk from Temasek Polytechnic’s West Gate and 12 minute walk from Tampines West MRT Station. If you are travelling via MRT, I would suggest taking Bus 46 opposite East View Primary School (bus stop ID 76289) after coming out from Tampines West MRT Station. You will arrive at Ninja Chirashi after 2 stops and a walk for another 3 minutes.
Upon my arrival at the eatery, I was quite frankly shocked at the relatively small size of the eatery, as well as how it was hidden within the neighbourhood by coffee shops to its left and right. What was even more surprising was that the entire eatery was manned by only 1 waiter, which is honestly quite rare even in the small eatery scenes. I can’t deny that this initially lowered my expectations of their dishes, but the food that entered my taste buds subsequently completely proved my expectations wrong as it blew my mind.
I ordered (1) Truffle Chirashi - which is a combination of Ninja Chirashi and Truffle Oil, and (2) Set A (4 Slices of Sashimi + Refillable Hot Tea).
The entire set meal cost me S$18.50, which honestly wasn’t very pricey because S$12.50 of it was from the Truffle Chirashi, which contained a very generous amount of raw Salmon and Tuna chunks.
The thickly cut cubes of raw Tuna and Salmon tasted very fresh, and when taken together with the rice drizzled with their secret sauce, it gave a very mellow savoury taste that makes me want to go back for another mouthful. The truffle oil and garlic bits elevated the flavour profile of the dish, giving it a nice crunch while having a hint of truffle flavour that wasn’t too overpowering. However, as I dug deeper into the dish, I started to run out of sashimi and tamago to pair with the rice, so it eventually came to a point where I had to eat four spoonfuls of rice on its own - which felt quite jelak. Nevertheless, as a whole, I thought the dish was really well executed.
I was also really heartened by the waiter, as despite being the only staff around, he really tried his best to juggle between serving the customer to the best of his ability while taking orders and packaging takeaways. Yes, it may be hard at times to catch his attention to ask for hot tea refills, but I can truly see that the waiter was putting his utmost effort into ensuring that his customers get a wonderful dining experience while smoothly running the eatery.
For that, I give Singapore’s Ninja Chirashi a 8/10 for flavour, 9/10 for service, and 7/10 for ambience because despite the small eatery space, they managed to enhanced the atmosphere with a neon logo on their wall for photo-taking, and memorable j-pop cum anime music playing in the background to pair with the homely view of the neighbourhood through the translucent window glass panel.
Overall, Ninja Chirashi at Tampines Street 81 scored a solid 24/30 after combining the scores for Flavour, Service, and Ambience. To quickly conclude, the eatery is a great spot to fix your sashimi don cravings if you are staying near Tampines.",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/1657179481_review_image1943982_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Japanese",,Truffle Chirashi Don,"Hidden deep within the heartlands of Tampines West, Ninja Chirashi is one of the newest additions to the neighbourhood at Blk 824 Tampines Street 83; a block away from Emi’s Waffle & Gelato which is also a recent addition to this area. Decked with neon lighting and colourful furnishings in a simple setting, Ninja Chirashi is an establishment that focuses on Chirashi Don; all served at an affordable price point.
Case in point, the Truffle Chirashi Don is one of the more affordable bowls here (priced at $11.90) which features thickly-cut cubes of salmon and tuna with diced cucumber, Tamago, Ebiko that is mixed in their “secret recipe Japanese sauce” with a dash of truffle oil and sprinkle of garlic bits over the top. Liked how the diced fish came being pretty chunky — allows one to enjoy the freshness of the fish while the fish came marinated in a mellow, savoury sauce carrying a slight hint of truffle fragrance that also helped to give some contrast to the Japanese short grain rice beneath that is served at room temperature; an attention to detail I actually liked. Otherwise, the other elements such as the cucumber did provide a good crunch, though the Tamago could admittedly be fresher for a better overall experience.
At prices starting from $9.90 with the Ninja Chirashi Don, the prices at Ninja Chirashi is hard to beat — some may argue that there isn’t quite enough fish, but its pretty much considered a steal given the thickly-sliced sashimi that one gets with the various bowls here. Needless to say, there is definitely some room for improvement — a fresher tamago will certainly give their value-for-money Chirashi Dons a boost. That being said, Tampines West residents are certainly a lucky bunch to score such an eatery within their vicinity — definitely somewhere I would find myself wind up in if I were to be staying close enough!",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/1c299c8a5a8fd04e5941884004_original.?w=20&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

“Mexicanos” 18-inches Large Hand Stretched Pizza $42.00
- Hand stretched by BLVD chef trained in Italian restaurant. - Baked in-house using wood fire with toppings Jalapeños, Black Olives, Oregano and Chili Peppers. Personally I like this pizza because it’s vegetarian, light and bell peppers were my favourite.
Oven-roasted Chicken $15.00 was delicious as well.
- Meat was tender with a Smokey aftertaste on the skin, I would recommend this dish to all my readers. Cajun-like dressing paired really well together with the meat too.

Kailash Parbat (Plaza 8 @ CBP),1 REVIEW,0 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$20/pax,"Indian
Vegetarian",,Kailash Parbat Restaurant,"Type: restaurant/indian
Amazing buffet lunch here! Wanted to visit as we were on a hunt for yummy Indian food and this place seemed like it would be value for money. It’s a vegetarian place btw! Really did not disappoint.
✔️ Pretty good spread with appetizers, side dishes, carbs, desserts, etc
✔️ Quality of food is good. Although it’s a buffet and you’d expect food to taste more average as it’s made in larger batch, everything we ate was really tasty and had standard. Tasted like something I ordered off a menu at restaurant standard (meaning just like cooked to order)
✔️Taste is really good. Some dishes were new to me and everything was impressive, especially the Chaats on the menu that day!
✔️Sincerity in cooking. I was impressed that they made some dishes in really small batches, esp Chaats which have a lot of crispy ingredients. To prevent from turning soggy with wet ingredients like sauces, they prepare in really small batches. In fact, we arrived pretty early when there weren’t many people around, and they made some portions served to our table for us
✔️Service is good. The staff are so friendly, and introduced the various dishes to us which was so helpful (I think because we obviously looked clueless about all the different Indian dishes but also pretty interested and curious)!
Would I recommend? Definitely! Drop by for their buffets which is super worth! So full after that. Just make sure to arrive earlier as the restaurant was super packed when we were leaving. I would love to revisit another day to try out a different buffet spread! :)
My rating: 5/5 ⭐️",https://burpple.imgix.net/foods/1680699472_review_image1965529_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Halal",*Halal-certified,"I was having gado gado cravings just a few days ago and fortunately for us, we managed to order the final plate when we were at Ayam Penyet President yesterday evening.","At $6.90, the price is pretty reasonable for the portion that we are getting, and this is the type of salad that I do not mind eating more often as the steamed vegetables, hard boiled egg and rice cake were topped with a peanut sauce and belinjo crackers. The star of the show was their fried chicken, and most people will usually order the Ayam Penyet ($7.50) that comes with their signature chilli paste. This time round, I went for the Ayam Cabe Ijo ($7.50) which was the fried chicken topped with green chilli mixed with anchovy. If you cannot handle your spice well, do consider getting a cold beverage by the side as the chilli packs a punch. I have not eaten many ayam penyet to determine the best version but the ones at Ayam Penyet President is a convenient and fuss free option for me.

Yesterday was a very gloomy day. So I went for something comfort. There were many ayam penyet stalls in lucky plaza but this stall was the only which was fully packed (at 2 in the afternoon). .
|
My order ➡️ fried catfish ($6.80) and Sop Buntut (Ox tail soup - $7.50). They seasoned the catfish with turmeric powder and salt then deep fried till crispy. I loved to eat catfish as it only had one center bone. Very easy to eat. With the right cooking method, it didn't have the muddy taste. .
|
Another of my favorite will be the ox tail soup. Simply use a fork and spoon, the meat will be easily removed from the ox. Super beefy taste and best with white rice.
Don't forget about their chilli! It changed the flavours and spiced up the experience. .

Halal",*Halal-certified,Beef Rendang One of the bonus points of having Ayam Penyet here is that they have a whole host of other dishes..,"the beef Rendang is something we ordered and although it's not the most tender or succulent, it's gravy is pretty authentic. It's borderlining between thick and watery and the familiar flavors of Rendang is prominent! It surely adds as a nice side dish to your meal.. oh not only that, the friendly staff told us there's even free soup which you can help yourself! 👍🏽

Chicken tasted typical with tasty chicken skin and their own spicy sambal. The side dishes are pretty standard too.. All in all It's a decent meal and kind of a 'treat' when you get to eat this during office lunch hours!

This morning has been a much cosy day with the heavy rain outside, so a much better reason to come here to try it.
For $12, you get a bowl of super warm and tasty fish soup. You immediately smell the durian when you gotten your bowl.
The soup was so tasty and sweet because of the durian that melt with the soup. They cooked 2 pieces of durian with it, but there wasn’t much durian meat left on the hoots. So do have your expectation before getting this.
For people who still prefer to have the durian meat alone, you definitely won’t get it with this fish soup.
But anyway as the owner explained, the soup remain a healthy option. But I felt they put too much pepper sauce to it, which make it hard to finish the bowl of soup at the end.",https://burpple-1.imgix.net/foods/52ed0a22338d03be9ec1903683_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Hence to me, though the soup can be bland tasting, i appreciate the insistence on making in healthy for customers and focusing their efforts on tastier ingredients and condiments.

When a good chef give some thought to his customers' eating experience, the food tend to taste better than usual. While balancing the food cost and keeping the food affordable and healthy, this is almost seem to be an impossible task. But this man, Mr Derrick a 2nd generation hawker, did it!! Every morning, he will go to the fish port to purchase the freshest ingredient and sold out on the same day! Hand made 8 different types of sauce so that the customers won't get bored with the taste. Every different he would had daily special like oysters and squid for topping up. .
|
When I was there at 6pm, he almost sold out for more of his items! So I managed to get the ""leftover"" bowl. Large amount of spinach, slices of grouper, ONE prawn and four tiny squid. This messy bowl of fish soup was OUTSTANDING! The sweetness of the soup didn't snatch away the highlight of the seafood. Every scoopful was screaming out of the taste of the sea. .

When any of you guys had the chance, call the number and reserved for his weekend jumbo pot (one whole lobster can be found inside) .

The tea is well brewed and the proportion of the milk, tea and gula melaka is nicely balanced - not too thin nor thick with each flavour shining through. I love that the gula melaka was not overly sweet too and it adds that smoky caramel fragrance.",https://burpple-2.imgix.net/foods/2eb1e787845b9e4d4f1a1668923_original.?w=420&dpr=1&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format

Old Tea Hut (Changi City Point),12 REVIEWS,1 WISHLISTED,Tampines,~$5/pax,Cafes & Coffee,,Gula Melaka Milk Tea,The Gula Melaka taste was quite strong with every mouth. Was disappointed that the milk tea taste was insignificant. Most probably the tea added wasn’t that much I guess. I’m gonna give it a second try when I pass by here again.
